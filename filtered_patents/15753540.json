  "abstract": "A method for perceiving physical bodies comprises the following steps: a) acquisition of a plurality of distance measurements of the physical bodies, arising from one or more sensor; b) application of an inverse sensor model on an occupancy grid to determine a probability of occupancy of a set of cells of the grid; and c) construction of a consolidated occupancy grid by fusion of the occupancy probabilities estimated during step b); wherein the inverse sensor model is a discrete model, associating with each cell of the corresponding occupancy grid, and for each distance measurement, a probability class chosen inside one and the same set of finite cardinality and identified by an integer index; and wherein step c) is implemented by means of integer computations performed on the indices of the probability classes determined during said step b). A system for perceiving physical bodies is also provided.",
