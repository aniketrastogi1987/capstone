  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>A quantum device may be summarized in at least one implementation as including three or more qubits and a coupler comprising a compound Josephson junction. The coupler is inductively coupled to each of the three or more qubits via a respective mutual inductance. The coupler is operable to provide a third-order interaction or a higher-order interaction among the three or more qubits. A reversible logic gate may be summarized in at least one implementation as including three qubits each having a state. The state of the first qubit is representative of a first input to the reversible logic gate, and the state of the second qubit is representative of a second input to the reversible logic gate. The state of the third qubit is representative of an output from the reversible logic gate. The reversible logic gate further comprises a coupler comprising a compound Josephson junction. The coupler is inductively coupled to each of the first, the second and the third qubits via a respective mutual inductance. The coupler is operable to provide a second-order interaction between each pair of qubits selected from the first, the second and the third qubits, and a third-order interaction among the first, the second and the third qubits. In some implementations, the reversible logic gate is a reversible exclusive OR (XOR) logic gate. In some implementations of the reversible XOR logic gate, a magnitude of the second-order interactions between each pair of qubits selected from the three qubits is essentially zero, and the magnitude of the third-order interaction among the three qubits is greater than zero. In some implementations of the reversible XOR logic gate, the magnitude of the second-order interactions between each pair of qubits selected from the three qubits is essentially zero (i.e., within a defined threshold of zero), and the magnitude of the third-order interaction among the three qubits is greater than zero (i.e., outside a defined threshold of ...",
