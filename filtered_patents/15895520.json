  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE <EOH>According to certain embodiments, systems and methods are disclosed for identifying computer-generated account identifiers. One method includes: receiving the account identifier; dividing the account identifier into a plurality of fragments; determining one or more features of at least one of the fragments; determining the commonness of at least one of the fragments; and determining if the account identifier is computer-generated based on the features of at least one of the fragments, and the commonness of at least one of the fragments. According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a system includes: a data storage device storing instructions determining if an account identifier is computer-generated; and a processor configured to execute the instructions to perform a method including: receiving the account identifier; dividing the account identifier into a plurality of fragments; determining one or more features of at least one of the fragments; determining the commonness of at least one of the fragments; and determining if the account identifier is computer-generated based on the features of at least one of the fragments, and the commonness of at least one of the fragments. According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method for determining whether an account identifier is computer-generated, the method including: receiving the account identifier; dividing the account identifier into a plurality of fragments; determining one or more features of at least one of the fragments; determining the commonness of at least one of the fragments; and determining if the account identifier is computer-generated based on the features of at least one of the fragments, and the commonness of at least one of the fragments.
