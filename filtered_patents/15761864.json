  "title": "UPDATING ATTRIBUTE DATA STRUCTURES TO INDICATE TRENDS IN ATTRIBUTE DATA PROVIDED TO AUTOMATED MODELLING SYSTEMS",
  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Certain aspects and examples are disclosed for updating attribute data structures, where a modified attribute data structure indicates attribute trends in training data or other input data for automated modeling systems. For example, a data structure stores data for training an automated modeling algorithm. The training data includes attribute values for multiple entities over a time period. A computing system generates, for each entity, at least one trend attribute that is a function of a respective time series of attribute values. Each trend attribute indicates a trend in the attribute-value time series. The computing system modifies the data structure to include the generated trend attributes and updates the training data to include trend attribute values for the trend attributes. The computing system trains the automated modeling algorithm with the trend attribute values from the data structure. In some aspects, trend attributes are generated by applying a frequency transform to a time series of attribute values and selecting, as trend attributes, some of the coefficients generated by the frequency transform.",
