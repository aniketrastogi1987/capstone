  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The present invention is directed to providing a self-learning system based on machine learning (ML) knowledge and an automated workflow which is capable of minimizing user intervention and prior knowledge required to create a workflow through a virtuous cycle of storing knowledge related to ML, suggesting a standardized structure that is available for users of various levels, recommending an optimal workflow based on knowledge stored in a corresponding structure, and applying a result of executing the recommended workflow to the knowledge. In particular, the present invention is directed to providing a self-learning system based on ML knowledge and an automated workflow which is capable of overcoming difficulties, which is caused by the technicality and step-by-step complexity of creating and determining a workflow, for a non-expert or a person who has not created a corresponding workflow in creating a workflow having the same effect. According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a self-learning system for automatically performing ML, the system including: a memory configured to store an ML knowledge database (DB) in which ML knowledge is stored and a program for automatically performing ML based on request information of a user; and a processor configured to execute the program stored in the memory. Here, when executing the program, the processor creates or recommends at least one workflow corresponding to the request information of the user based on the ML knowledge stored in the ML knowledge DB and generates an execution code for performing the created or recommended workflow. The ML knowledge DB may include at least one of user knowledge obtained by transforming scope of modification in workflow based on user type into knowledge, domain knowledge obtained by transforming scope of modification in workflow based on features of analysis-target domains into knowledge, guide knowledge in which information stru...",
