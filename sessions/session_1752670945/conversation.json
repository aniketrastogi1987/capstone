Here's an improved abstract:\n\n---\n\n**Abstract:**\nA novel method and system are disclosed for enhancing the accuracy of base calling in nucleotide sequencing. The approach involves obtaining raw data from one or more sequencing devices, which includes luminescent signals corresponding to nucleotides during incorporation events. This raw data is then processed by a learning-enabled, automatic base calling module that produces preliminary base calls. By comparing these initial base calls with actual values derived from the raw data, an update mechanism is triggered to refine and enhance the accuracy of future base calls. The system uses deep learning algorithms trained on this comparison data to create and distribute updates to sequencing devices, thereby improving overall nucleotide identification precision. This method significantly advances the field by automating the process of updating base calling modules without manual intervention, leading to more reliable and efficient sequencing outcomes.\n\n---\n\nThis revised abstract aims to clearly convey the technical innovation while emphasizing the advantages over existing methods in terms of automation and accuracy enhancement through deep learning techniques.
