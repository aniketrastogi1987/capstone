For example, `\"machine learning\" AND neural network`\n- Use OR between similar terms for broader coverage, like `\"predictive analytics\" OR \"data processing\"`\n- Employ wildcards to find variations of a term: `learn*` will match words such as \"learning,\" \"learner,\" and \"learns.\"\n\n### Step 3: Search in Patent Databases\n#### Google Patents\n1. Go to [Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/)\n2. In the search bar, enter your query (e.g., `\"machine learning\" AND neural network`)\n3. Utilize filters on the left-hand side to narrow down results by date, classification, inventor/patent holder, etc.\n\n#### USPTO Patent Full-Text Search\n1. Use the advanced search options at [USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/)\n2. Enter your keywords and apply relevant filters\n\n#### Espacenet (European Patent Office)\n1. Visit [Espacenet](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/)\n2. Go to the \u201cAdvanced\u201d tab for more detailed searches.\n3. Use specific classification codes like G06N3/08 (Machine learning; Neural networks) if known.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Patents\n- **Abstract and Title:** These will give you a quick understanding of what each patent is about.\n- **Claims Section:** This section details what the patent actually claims protection for.\n- **Description:** Contains detailed technical information, diagrams, and flowcharts that explain how the system works.\n\n### Step 5: Find Similar Inventions\n- Look at references cited by a patent to see other patents it builds upon or references citing this one which may use similar techniques or improvements.\n- Use patent classification codes (IPC/CPC) to discover related technologies in the same field.\n\n### Step 6: Prior Art Search\nTo determine if your idea is novel:\n1. **Specific Keywords:** Use exact phrases and technical specifications from your invention for searching.\n2. **Historical Patents:** Look at early developments in machine learning as they often set precedents and can be crucial for understanding the landscape of a technology area.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to uncover patents related to \"machine learning\" along with similar inventions and technologies. For more detailed analysis or if you need help interpreting specific patents, feel free to reach out!\n\n\ud83d\udccb LOCAL SEARCH RESULTS:\nNo local patents found related to 'machine learning patents'.\nWould you like to analyze any specific patent from these results?",
