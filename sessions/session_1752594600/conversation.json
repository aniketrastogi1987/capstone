      "user_query": "Description\ntranslated from Chinese\nA Deep Learning Topic Sentiment Classification Method Based on Data Augmentation\ntechnical field\n\nThe present invention relates to the field of natural language processing, and more specifically, relates to a deep learning topic sentiment classification method based on data enhancement.\n\nBackground technique\n\nIn recent years, Internet technology has become more and more mature, and people are accustomed to communicating with each other and expressing their ideas online. During this period, a lot of text information was retained on the Internet, and sentiment analysis technology aims to dig out the opinions and tendencies of customers expressing emotions about certain things from these text information, and provide information for subsequent specific application scenarios such as store innovation, etc. With technical support, sentiment analysis technology has high application value in academia and industry.\n\nThe topic-level sentiment analysis is to judge the emotional tendency of a sentence about a certain topic, which plays a pivotal role in sentiment analysis. At present, the commonly used analysis methods mainly include methods based on sentiment lexicon and machine learning. The method based on the sentiment lexicon is to comprehensively evaluate the emotional tendency of the sentence on the topic by looking for the number of emotional words on the topic in the sentence and their emotional polarity. The focus of this step is to determine the What are the emotional vocabulary and then conduct statistical analysis. This method is simple and easy to operate. However, the shortcomings are also obvious: 1. The quality of the constructed sentiment dictionary is very high, and some implicitly expressing sentiment words are easily ignored, resulting in a decline in the accuracy of sentiment analysis. 2. It is necessary to accurately locate the emotional words about a certain topic in the current sentence. If the positioning is not accurate, it will cause misclassification and reduce the classification performance. Therefore, methods based on sentiment lexicons are gradually replaced by other methods. At present, many studies adopt machine learning sentiment analysis method, first regard it as a classification problem, select the features that are conducive to the sentiment analysis and judgment of the topic from the labeled training samples, and then train a classifier model (such as the recent Ortho KNN, Bayesian and Support Vector Machine SVM, etc.) to predict the emotional polarity of an unknown sentence on a topic. This method classifies better than sentiment lexicon-based methods, but still falls short of expectations.\n\nAnalyze one of the reasons for the poor classification effect that is currently occurring---the small size of the data set. Consider that by expanding the new data set on the basis of the original data set, the deep network has a more powerful classification ability. Since the word that affects the emotional polarity of a certain topic in a sentence is not the only one, I thought about digging out the word that has the greatest impact on the emotional polarity judgment in a sentence, and put it into the deep network as a new training set Retraining, on the one hand, can achieve the purpose of expanding the data set, so as to enhance the extraction and learning of the characteristics of the data set by the deep network; In this way, the classification effect of the classifier can be improved, and the accuracy rate will be higher.\n\nContents of the invention\n\nThe invention provides a deep learning topic emotion classification method based on data enhancement with high accuracy.\n\nIn order to achieve the above-mentioned technical effect, the technical scheme of the present invention is as follows:\n\nA deep learning topic sentiment classification method based on data enhancement, comprising the following steps:\n\nS1: Establish a deep learning network model G for generating semantic information, feature representation and classifiers for sentences;\n\nS2: Select the most important words affecting sentiment analysis in the training set according to the deep learning network model G to form a new training set;\n\nS3: The deep learning network model G is trained again according to the original training set and the new training set, and then tested.\n\nFurther, the specific process of the step S1 is:\n\nS11: Use the bert pre-trained language model to represent each word in the pre-trained sentence with a low-dimensional, dense real number vector, and since the bert pre-trained language model itself already contains the semantics of each word Modeling, therefore, each word output by bert has semantic information, so the entire sentence is represented as X=[x 1 ,\u2026,x t ,\u2026,x n ], where n is the length of the sentence, and the vector matrix X The dimension of is 768 dimensions;\n\nS12: According to the word vector representation after the bert layer already has certain semantic information, it is also necessary to let the model learn the context information of each word in the sentence, and use a two-way GRU network to learn the context information of the sentence; let each word represent a time Step t, the input of each GRU cell unit is the word vector x t at the current time t and the hidden layer output h ft-1 of the GRU cell at the time t-1, and the expression of the forward GRU is obtained as H f =[h f1 ,\u2026 ,h ft ,\u2026h fn ], similarly, the expression of backward GRU is H b \uff1d[h b1 ,\u2026,h bt ,\u2026h bn ]\n\nS13: In order to learn the relationship between each word of the sentence and the topic word, an attention layer is built to calculate the weight of each word about the topic word. The greater the weight, the more the word affects the emotional polarity of the sentence about the current topic. Big, first, each word is represented by S12 as H=H f +H b , the word vector of the current topic word is represented as e N , and then the two vectors are spliced and the tanh activation function is used, and the obtained vector is represented as M=tanh ([H; e N ]), and then learn a parameter W to calculate the weight of each word about the topic word and multiply it by the GRU output of each word in the corresponding position to obtain the overall representation of the sentence about the topic word r, where r=H softmax(W T M);\n\nS14: Establish the last output layer, and map the sentence representation r obtained in S13 to three classification categories through two layers of fully connected layers and a layer of softmax, corresponding to the emotional polarity of the current sentence being positive, negative and neutral. Probability, and then output the emotional polarity with the highest probability according to the probability, and output the result;\n\nS15: Train the training data in the data set according to the above process. During the training process, cross-entropy is used as the loss function, ADAM optimizer is used for optimization, L2 regularization is used to prevent over-fitting, and finally the parameters of the network are saved.\n\nFurther, the specific process of the step S2 is:\n\nS21: Replace each word in each sentence of the training data with [MASK], set the current sentence as s=[w 1 ,...,w t ,...,w n ], n represents the current sentence contains The number of words, the sentence set s\u2032 after each sentence has been replaced one by one has a total of n sentences, where s\u2032 is {[[MASK],\u2026,w t ,\u2026,w n ],\u2026,[w 1 ,\u2026,[MASK],\u2026,w n ],\u2026,[w 1 ,\u2026,w t ,\u2026,[MASK]]}.\n\nS22: Reload the network parameters saved in S15 to obtain the network G that has been trained before, and then input each sentence of s\u2032 into the network G to obtain a probability distribution for predicting emotional polarity, and then select a probability distribution that is far from the real emotion The sentence with the farthest distribution is put into the new training set, and the new training set is twice as large, and each sentence digs out the word that most affects the emotional polarity of the sentence, which enhances the model's classification ability.\n\nFurther, the specific process of the step S3 is:\n\nS31: Put the training set generated in S22 together with the original training data as the training set into the network already trained in S15, and then conduct another training according to the process of S1. The cross entropy is still used as the loss function during training. ADAM is used as an optimizer, using L2 regularization, the learning rate is set to 0.01, and the model converges after training for 5 epochs.\n\nS32: Put the test data into the network trained in S31 for testing, and the test index is measured by accuracy rate.\n\nFurther, in the step S22, the judgment rule of the sentence farthest from the real emotion distribution is:\n\nAssume that the true emotional distribution is y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , y n , the real label is y t , and the set of all predicted probability distributions is {(x 11 , x 12 , x 13 ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, x 1n ),(x 21 ,x 22 ,x 23 ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\uff0cx 2n ),\u2026,(x m1 ,x m2 ,x m3 ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\uff0cx mn )}, find the smallest x it , where The corresponding distribution (x i1 , x i2 , x i3 ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, x in ) is the sentence farthest from the real emotion distribution.\n\nCompared with the prior art, the beneficial effects of the technical solution of the present invention are:\n\nThe present invention enables the word to obtain a preliminary semantic information through the bert pre-training language model, and then learns the contextual semantic features between words through a two-way GRU network, and proposes a method of enhancing data at the same time, by eliminating each sentence The most influential words in the emotional polarity force the model to learn the judgment of the emotional polarity of more difficult sentences. At the same time, expanding the data set enables the model to capture features from more data sets. Experiments on the corresponding data sets show that the present invention has a greater improvement compared with the previous emotion classification method.",

Previous works, like \"TextBert: Fine-tuning BERT for Text Classification,\" focus more on text classification rather than sentiment analysis and do not integrate Bi-GRU networks.\n\n- **Attention Mechanism for Sentiment Analysis**:\n  - Applying an attention mechanism specifically to weigh each word relative to the topic in sentiment analysis is unique. While \"Attention is All You Need\" uses similar mechanisms, it does not detail their application in sentiment analysis or BERT-based systems.\n\n- **Data Augmentation via Masking**:\n  - The method of replacing key sentiment-affecting words with `[MASK]` and selecting sentences for retraining based on deviation from the true emotional distribution is innovative. Existing data augmentation techniques like those in \"Effective Use of Word Order for Statistical Machine Translation\" do not cover this specific approach.\n\n### Patentability Assessment:\n\n1. **Non-obviousness**:\n   - Combining BERT, a two-way GRU network, attention mechanisms tailored to sentiment analysis, and unique data augmentation via masking represents an inventive step that is non-obvious to someone skilled in the art.\n   \n2. **Utility**:\n   - The method has practical utility by improving the accuracy and robustness of sentiment analysis systems across various applications such as online customer reviews.\n\n3. **Scope of Protection**:\n   - Claims should cover specific aspects including using BERT for preliminary semantic representation, employing a bidirectional GRU network to learn context information, implementing an attention mechanism that calculates word weights relative to topic relevance, and performing data augmentation through sentence masking and selection.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe invention appears novel and patentable due to its innovative combination of existing techniques (BERT, Bi-GRU networks, attention mechanisms) applied in a unique manner for sentiment analysis. This method enhances the accuracy and robustness of models by learning from more challenging sentences generated through data augmentation via masking.
