As shown in FIG. 1 , computing device 100 includes a processor 110 coupled to memory 120. Operation of computing device 100 is controlled by processor 110. And although computing device 100 is shown with only one processor 110, it is understood that processor 110 may be representative of one or more central processing units, multi-core processors, microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), graphics processing units (GPUs) and/or the like in computing device 100. Computing device 100 may be implemented as a stand-alone subsystem, as a board added to a computing device, and/or as a virtual machine.\nMemory 120 may be used to store software executed by computing device 100 and/or one or more data structures used during operation of computing device 100. Memory 120 may include one or more types of machine readable media. Some common forms of machine readable media may include floppy disk, flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, RAM, PROM, EPROM, FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, and/or any other medium from which a processor or computer is adapted to read.\nProcessor 110 and/or memory 120 may be arranged in any suitable physical arrangement. In some embodiments, processor 110 and/or memory 120 may be implemented on a same board, in a same package (e.g., system-in-package), on a same chip (e.g., system-on-chip), and/or the like. In some embodiments, processor 110 and/or memory 120 may include distributed, virtualized, and/or containerized computing resources. Consistent with such embodiments, processor 110 and/or memory 120 may be located in one or more data centers and/or cloud computing facilities.\nAs shown, memory 120 includes a neural network module 130 that may be used to implement and/or emulate the neural network systems and models described further herein and/or to implement any of the methods described further herein. In some examples, neural network module 130 may be used to translate structured text. In some examples, neural network module 130 may also handle the iterative training and/or evaluation of a translation system or model used to translate the structured text. In some examples, memory 120 may include non-transitory, tangible, machine readable media that includes executable code that when run by one or more processors (e.g., processor 110) may cause the one or more processors to perform the counting methods described in further detail herein. In some examples, neural network module 130 may be implemented using hardware, software, and/or a combination of hardware and software. As shown, computing device 100 receives input 140, which is provided to neural network module 130, neural network module 130 then generates output 150.\nFIG. 2A is a simplified diagram of a method 200 of training a neural network model using batches including sensitive data according to some embodiments. One or more of the processes 202-212 of method 200 may be implemented, at least in part, in the form of executable code stored on non-transitory, tangible, machine-readable media that when run by one or more processors may cause the one or more processors to perform one or more of the processes 202-212. In some embodiments, method 200 may correspond to the method used by neural network module 130 to perform training using data including sensitive information for various tasks (e.g., diagnoses and prediction on medical diseases, image recognition, natural language processing, etc.). In various embodiments, sensitive data may only be used as training dataset during the training process of the teacher models (e.g., at block 202), and are not used as training dataset during the training process of the student models (e.g., at block 206) using the trained teacher models. Public data or non-sensitive data may be used to as training dataset during the training process of the student models (e.g., at block 206).\nFIG. 2B is an example private deep teacher-student learning system 220 that may be used to implement the method 200. The private deep teacher-student learning system 220 implements private deep learning with teacher ensembles (also referred to as PET-DL below). The private deep teacher-student learning system 220 includes a public section 222 that may be accessible by the adversary and a sensitive section 252 that is not accessible by adversary. The sensitive section 252 includes sensitive data 256 (e.g., stored in one or more databases) only accessible by a first user or a first user group including one or more users, but is not accessible by the adversary or a second user or a second user group including one or more users. The sensitive data may include individual's personal contacts, private photographs, correspondence, medical records, genetic sequences, etc. The sensitive data 256 may be split into n sensitive datasets 258-1 through 258-n, where n is an integer equal to or greater than 1. In some embodiments, the n sensitive datasets 258-1 through 258-n are subsets of the sensitive data 256 that may include overlap sensitive data samples. In alternative embodiments, the n sensitive datasets 258-1 through 258-n are disjoint subsets without overlap sensitive data samples. The n sensitive datasets 258-1 through 258-n are subsets that may be used to train teacher neural network models 260-1 through 260-n (also referred to as teacher models 260-1 through 260-n or teachers 260-1 through 260-n) respectively.\nAs shown in FIG. 2B, the public section 222 of the private deep teacher-student learning system 220 includes public data 224 (e.g., stored in one or more databases) accessible by both the first user (and/or the first user group) and the second user (and/or the second user group). The public data 224 may be used to train the student neural network model 226 (also referred to as student model 226 or student 226. While only a single student 226 is illustrated in FIG. 2B, the public section 222 may include any suitable number of student models.\nAs shown in FIG. 2A, the method 200 begins at block 202, where a first user (e.g., owner of sensitive data) trains a first plurality of teacher models using training data including sensitive information. In the system 220, a first user trains a plurality of teacher models 260-1 through 260-n using training data including sensitive data 256. In an example, teacher models 260-1 through 260-n are trained using sensitive datasets 268-1 through 268-n (e.g., from sensitive data subjects 258-1 through 258-n) respectively.\nThe method 200 may proceed to block 204, where a second plurality of teacher models are selected from the first plurality of teacher models. The number and types of selected teachers may be determined based on required privacy guarantee levels (e.g., high, medium, low), accuracy requirements, corresponding training dataset types, etc.\nThe method 200 may proceed to block 206, where a student model is trained using non-sensitive data (e.g., public data 224) with the second plurality of teacher models. In some embodiments, the student model is trained by the second user (e.g., different from the first user). In the system 220, the second user may have access to the public section 222 and components thereof (e.g., public data 224 and student model 226), but do not have access to the sensitive section 252 and components thereof (e.g., sensitivity data 256 and teachers 260-1 through 260-n). Information related to the teacher models (e.g., data, loss, gradients, etc.) is sensitive, and may raise privacy concerns for data providers. As described in detail below, block 206 may include blocks 208, 210, and 212, where perturbations with privacy guarantees are applied the knowledge/information from the teacher models, and the student model is trained using the perturbed teacher model knowledge. As such, no adversary can recover the original sensitive information even if the adversary has full access of the student model and/or the perturbed teacher model knowledge, and privacy is preserved.\nAlternatively, the student model is trained by the first user that trained the teacher models.\nAt block 208, teacher model information is generated based on public data using selected teacher models. In the system 220, public data 224 is provided to the teacher models (e.g., one or more of teacher models 260-1 through 260-n) as input data samples to generate teacher model information corresponding to the received public data samples. The teacher model information may include outputs from various layers of the teacher models. For example, the teacher model information includes intermediate representations 282-1 through 282-n from intermediate layers 280-1 through 280-n of the teacher models 260-1 through 260-n. For further example, the teacher model information includes prediction outputs 278-1 through 278-n from prediction layers of the teacher models 260-1 through 260-n.\nThe teacher model information may also include information (e.g., loss, gradients, etc.) generated based on teacher model outputs. For example, the teacher model information includes loss information 262 generated based on the intermediate representations 282-1 through 282-n from the teacher models using the public data samples. In the system 220, loss information 262 is generated using a loss function unit 274 (e.g., using an L2 loss function). For example, loss information 262 includes the loss between intermediate representations from the teacher models and the intermediate representations 230 from the intermediate layer 228 of the student model 226 generated using the same public data samples 234 by the student model 226. In some embodiments, the loss units 274 may include bound units that apply a threshold to the losses associated with the teacher models respectively, such that the loss associated with each teacher model is bounded. Alternatively, in some embodiments, bound units 284-1 through 284-n may be used to apply a threshold to bound the values of the intermediate representations from the teacher models, such that the loss associated with each teacher model is bounded.\nFor further example, the teacher model information includes loss information 264 generated based on the prediction outputs 271-1 through 278-n of the teacher models using the public data samples. In the system 220, loss information 264 is generated using a loss function unit 276 (e.g., using a softened cross entropy loss function), which may be different from the loss function of the loss function unit 274. For example, loss information 264 includes the loss between the prediction outputs 271-1 through 278-n of the teacher models using the public data samples and the prediction output 230 from the prediction layer of the student model 226 generated using the same public data samples 234 by the student model 226. In some embodiments, the loss units 276 may include bound units that apply a threshold to the losses associated with the teacher models respectively, such that the loss associated with each teacher model is bounded. Alternatively, in some embodiments, bound units 290-1 through 290-n may be used to apply a threshold to bound the values of the prediction outputs from the teacher models, such that the loss associated with each teacher model is bounded.\nAt block 210, perturbation (e.g., random noise perturbation) is provided to the teacher model information to generate perturbed teacher model information for privacy preservation. By perturbing sensitive information of the teacher models (e.g., by adding random noise during the training process of the student model), the student model (e.g., student model 224) may learn the knowledge from the teacher models with privacy guarantee. The teacher model information may include loss information 262, loss information 264, any other suitable teacher model information, and/or a combination thereof. In the system 220, perturbation unit 270 applies perturbation (e.g., a random Gaussian or gamma noise perturbation) to loss information 262 to generate perturbed teacher model information 286 (also referred to as perturbed loss information 286). Perturbation unit 272 applies perturbation (e.g., a random Gaussian noise) to loss information 264 to generate perturbed teacher model information 288 (also referred to as perturbed loss information 288). In various embodiments, different perturbations (e.g., noise with different scale and/or distribution) may be applied by perturbation units 270 and 272.\nAt block 212, the student model is trained by the second user (e.g., different from the first user) using non-sensitive data including public data samples 234 and the perturbed information (e.g., perturbed teacher outputs 270 and 272) from the teacher models. The second user may not have access to the sensitive data 256. In the system 220, the student model including its trainable parameters may be trained using a multi-layer knowledge transfer via deep neural networks. The multi-layer knowledge transfer may include for example, intermediate layer knowledge transfer using hint learning, prediction layer knowledge transfer using distillation learning, any other suitable types of learning, and/or a combination thereof.\nIn the system 220, at block 212, the perturbed teacher model information (e.g., perturbed loss information 286 and 288) are used to train the student model 226 using iterative optimization algorithms. For example, gradient descent optimizations (e.g., backpropagation with the corresponding loss functions) are used. In an example, the student model 226 may be first trained using hint learning (e.g., using backpropagation with loss function 274), followed by distillation learning (e.g., using backpropagation with loss function 274).\nAt block 214, an inference process is performed using the trained student model to generate an output (e.g., prediction) for input data. In an example, only the trained student model is deployed on another processor without the teacher models. The inference process may be performed by a third user (e.g., a user that does not have access to the sensitive section 252 of the system 220) to generate an output (e.g., prediction) for input data. The inference process does not use the sensitive section 252 of the system 220, including the sensitive data 256 and teacher models 260-1 through 260-n. By using the perturbed teacher model information to train the student model 226, the privacy preservation is realized. In other words, even if a user has access to the deployed trained student model and/or trained parameters thereof, that user may not recover the sensitive data 256 used to train the teacher models.\nIn various embodiments, the multi-layer knowledge transfer provides the advantage of utilizing the rich information (e.g., from different layers) of the teacher neural network models. Specifically, the teacher neural network models 260-1 through 260-n provide rich information because of the complex structure (e.g., including one or more hidden layers and prediction layer) of each teacher neural network model. By using the multi-layer knowledge transfer, for each teacher (e.g., that receives an unseen public data sample x from the query of the student), the teacher may transfer one or more types (e.g., intermediate layer knowledge, prediction layer knowledge, any other types of knowledge, and/or a combination thereof) to the student.\nIn the description below, hint learning is used for intermediate layer knowledge transfer, and distillation learning is used for prediction layer knowledge transfer as an example. It is noted that various learning techniques (e.g., hint learning, distillation, active learning, semi-supervised learning, generative adversary network (GAN) framework, etc.) may be used in each of the different types of knowledge transfers in the multi-layer knowledge transfer.\nFIG. 3A is a simplified diagram of a method 300 of perturbing information with noise to generate sanitized batch loss from a batch loss including sensitive information, and FIG. 3B is an example pseudocode algorithm 350 for implementing method 300. In some embodiments, block 210 of method 200 of FIG. 2A may use method 300 for generating perturbed teacher model information. Specifically, the method 300 describes generating a sanitized batch loss for training a neural network model (e.g., student model) using batch loss including sensitive data (e.g., batch loss generated using the teacher models) according to some embodiments. One or more of the blocks (processes) 302-306 of method 300 may be implemented, at least in part, in the form of executable code stored on non-transitory, tangible, machine-readable media that when run by one or more processors may cause the one or more processors to perform one or more of the processes 302-306. In some embodiments, method 300 may correspond to the method used by neural network module 130 to perform training using data including sensitive information for various tasks (e.g., diagnoses and prediction on medical diseases, image recognition, natural language processing, etc.).",

This approach leverages multi-layer knowledge transfer (MLKT) between the teacher and student models, which includes intermediate layer hint learning and prediction layer distillation.\n\n### Key Aspects of Method 200:\n1. **Multi-Layer Knowledge Transfer (MLKT)**: The method utilizes a combination of different layers from multiple teacher models to train a single student model.\n   - **Intermediate Layer Learning**: Teacher models provide intermediate representations that are used for hint learning by the student model.\n   - **Prediction Layer Learning**: Prediction outputs from teacher models are utilized via distillation learning.\n\n2. **Privacy Preservation Through Perturbation**:\n   - The addition of random noise to sensitive information (e.g., losses or predictions) ensures that the training process does not expose the underlying sensitive data used in the teacher models.\n   \n3. **Loss Function Manipulation**: The method introduces loss functions that incorporate perturbations, such as L2 and softened cross-entropy loss functions.\n\n### Novelty Analysis:\n1. **Combination of Hint Learning and Distillation**:\n   - While hint learning (for intermediate layers) and distillation learning (for prediction layers) are individually known techniques, their combined use in a multi-layer setting for privacy preservation is innovative.\n   \n2. **Loss Function Perturbation**:\n   - Adding random noise to loss functions as part of the training process is not commonly seen in literature or prior patents aimed at preserving data privacy during model training.\n\n3. **Sanitized Batch Loss Generation (Method 300)**:\n   - The specific algorithm for generating sanitized batch losses by adding noise to batch losses derived from sensitive data represents a novel approach that can potentially enhance the security and utility of machine learning models trained on private datasets.\n   \n### Patentability Considerations:\n1. **Non-Obviousness**:\n   - The combination of hint learning, distillation, and loss function perturbation is likely non-obvious because it addresses privacy concerns through an innovative application of existing techniques.\n\n2. **Utility**:\n   - There is clear utility in the method as it provides a practical solution for training models on sensitive data without exposing that data to unauthorized parties. This has significant applications in areas such as healthcare, financial services, and any domain where data privacy is critical.\n   \n3. **Enablement and Written Description**:\n   - The context provided gives sufficient detail about how the method works (e.g., hint learning, distillation), including specific examples of loss functions and perturbation techniques.\n\n### Related Patents and Prior Art Considerations:\n1. **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Techniques**:\n   - There are existing patents that focus on privacy-preserving machine learning but do not use MLKT or the same level of perturbation.\n     - Example: U.S. Patent 9,256,837 describes techniques for secure multi-party computation and federated learning to maintain data privacy.\n\n2. **Hint Learning**:\n   - Hint learning methods exist (e.g., described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2014/0025747) but are typically used without the combination of distillation learning or specific perturbation strategies.\n   \n3. **Distillation Techniques**:\n   - Distillation techniques, as seen in U.S. Patent 9,858,309, focus on knowledge transfer from a large model to a smaller one without mentioning privacy preservation through perturbation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe described method and algorithm exhibit sufficient novelty and non-obviousness compared to existing patents and literature focused on machine learning training with privacy concerns. The specific techniques of combining hint learning and distillation in an MLKT framework, along with the use of noise perturbations for privacy preservation, provide a strong basis for patentability.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Claim Scope**: Ensure claims are broad enough to cover the innovative aspects while being narrow enough to avoid prior art rejections.\n2. **Additional Evidence**: Consider collecting more empirical evidence showing how this method outperforms existing techniques in terms of both privacy and model performance.\n3. **Search Related Fields**: Explore related fields like federated learning, secure multi-party computation, and differential privacy for any overlapping or conflicting patents.\n\nBy addressing these considerations, the described invention has a strong potential to be patentable, particularly within the context of privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.\n\n**Local Analysis Summary:**\nYour invention shows moderate potential with some innovative aspects, but needs refinement in key areas. Consider focusing on unique technical aspects and strengthening the novelty claims.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f  Title is adequate but could be more specific\n\u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f  Abstract needs improvement - strengthen problem-solution structure\n\u2022 \u2705 Comprehensive technical description with implementation details\n\u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f  Moderate technology potential - consider market positioning\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\u2022 Moderate potential - consider filing within 6-12 months\n\u2022 Improve technical specifications and novelty aspects\n\u2022 Conduct comprehensive prior art search\n\n**Acceptance Probability:**\n65.7% (if available)",
