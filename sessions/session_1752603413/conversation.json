Raw data sources are mainly divided into three categories: structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. In general, the structured data is stored in a relational database and a non-relational database, and the structured data can be converted into RDF data through a D2R technology so as to complete the construction of a knowledge graph. Semi-structured data refers to data that has a certain data structure, and that requires further analysis to obtain, such as encyclopedia data, web page data, and the like. For such data, the data structure can be customized analyzed, and the data is converted into structured data by adopting a regular expression or a crawling analysis means of a webpage, so as to form a knowledge graph. Whereas unstructured data, because of the unstructured nature of its data, cannot generally be converted directly into structured data by simple analysis. Generally, for unstructured data, entities therein, such as person names, place names, organization structure names, time, etc., and relationships between the respective entities may be extracted, thereby attempting to form a knowledge graph.\nThe current knowledge graph construction process generally comprises the following steps: preprocessing the original data, converting the original data into structured data, and then carrying out entity alignment, knowledge fusion, knowledge reasoning and the like to construct and form a complete knowledge graph.\nAt present, although more theoretical researches are carried out on the unstructured data to construct a knowledge graph, no technical means for truly falling to the ground are provided.\nDisclosure of Invention\nIn view of the above, the present invention provides a method for extracting relationships and constructing knowledge patterns based on a deep learning model, which is used for solving the problems in the prior art.\nA relation extraction and knowledge graph construction method based on a deep learning model specifically comprises the following steps:\ns1, processing corpus data into labeling data by using a data labeling platform;\ns2, taking the labeling data as input, training and testing a deep learning model, and generating a relation extraction model;\ns3, inputting the text data to be extracted into a relation extraction model, and extracting entity relation pairs of the text to be extracted;\nand S4, importing the entity relation pairs into a graph database to construct a knowledge graph of the text to be extracted.\nPreferably, in step S1, the specific steps of processing the corpus data into the labeling data by using the data labeling platform are as follows:\ns11, acquiring network data from the Internet through a crawler system;\ns12, segmenting the network data according to sentences to form a sentence corpus;\ns13, labeling the corpus data in the sentence corpus by using a data labeling platform to form labeling data.\nPreferably, the network data is data of a plurality of fields crawled by a crawler system from different sources of the internet;\nafter the network data is obtained, the network data is manually classified according to the domain category.\nPreferably, the network data is unstructured data in one or more formats of TXT text, word text and PDF text.\nPreferably, the data labeling platform is a visual data labeling platform in the form of a webpage.\nPreferably, the specific steps for generating the relation extraction model in step S2 are:\ns21, acquiring a training sample and a test sample from the labeling data;\ns22, preprocessing a training sample, inputting preprocessed data into a BERT model for pre-training, and obtaining an initial word vector;\ns23, training the initial word vector by adopting a two-way long-short-term memory network model and a conditional random field algorithm until the neural network converges to obtain an initial relation extraction model;\ns24, inputting the test sample into the initial relation extraction model for testing, and obtaining the relation extraction model meeting the requirements when the accuracy of the test sample reaches a set value.\nPreferably, in step S3, the text data to be extracted is input into a relation extraction model, and the specific steps of extracting the entity relation pair of the text to be extracted are as follows:\ns31, segmenting text data to be extracted into a plurality of sentences;\ns32, inputting all sentences obtained by segmentation into a relation extraction model, and extracting a plurality of entity relation pairs;\ns33, manually checking the extracted entity relation pairs, and eliminating the wrong entity relation pairs.\nPreferably, the map database adopts Neo4j map database.\nThe beneficial effects of the invention are as follows:\n1. the corpus data adopted by the method is the corpus with various formats and sources, and the annotation of the corpus takes sentences as a unit, so that the corpus data is not limited by the corpus format and the content.\n2.
