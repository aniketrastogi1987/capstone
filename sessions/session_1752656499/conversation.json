      "user_query": "The present application relates generally to an improved data processing apparatus and method and more specifically to mechanisms for providing a verifiable deep learning training service.\nDeep learning systems have been widely deployed as part of artificial intelligence (AI) services due to their ability to approach human performance when performing cognitive tasks. Deep learning is a class of machine learning technology that uses a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer of input. The deep learning system is trained using supervised, e.g., classification, and/or unsupervised, e.g., pattern analysis, learning mechanisms. The learning may be performed with regard to multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction, with the levels forming a hierarchy of concepts.\nMost modern deep learning models are based on an artificial neural network, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in Deep Belief Networks and Deep Boltzmann Machines. In deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In an facial image recognition application, for example, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels with the first representational layer abstracting the pixels and encoding edges, the second layer composing and encoding arrangements of edges, the third layer encoding a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer recognizing that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own, but this does not completely obviate the need for hand-tuning. For example, hand tuning may be used to vary the number of layers and layer sizes so as to provide different degrees of abstraction.\nThe \u201cdeep\u201d in \u201cdeep learning\u201d refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves a CAP depth greater than 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network, but the extra layers help in learning features.\nSUMMARY\nThis Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described herein in the Detailed Description.

Large numbers of computing resources, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and storage, are needed to perform training of these deep learning models. Individual developers or small business/academic units who intend to build their own customized deep learning models often rely on deep learning training services from large cloud service providers. However, users of training services have concerns for the confidentiality and integrity of their training data as the training data may contain sensitive or classified information which should not be exposed to the cloud service provider. In addition, users expect that the final trained deep learning model should be built only upon the training data provisioned by them and the training data should not be compromised or poisoned in the supply chain; otherwise, adversaries could embed malicious backdoors in the trained deep learning model. Such trojan logic is difficult to detect and prune by analyzing the trained deep learning model's parameters.\nThe abundance and diversity of training data are the key factors for building successful machine learning (ML) models. High-quality training data is a scarce resource and typically is under the control of different parties. Collaborative learning, in which multiple parties contribute their private data to jointly train a ML model with common objectives, can potentially address the problem of inadequate high-quality training resources. The various parties that collaborate in this way are referred to as training data contributors. While such collaboration provides larger training datasets upon which to perform training of the ML models, in many mission-critical and privacy-sensitive domains, such as medical care, forensic investigation, intellectual property, etc., sharing raw data is not desirable to the owners of the raw data and, in some cases, may not be permitted by law or regulations.\nTo satisfy the requirements of security and privacy from different training data contributors, a privacy-preserving collaborative learning mechanism should be designed. In designing such a privacy-preserving collaborative learning mechanism, before training of the collaborative learning mechanism begins, all training participants, including both training data contributors and training infrastructure providers, should come to a consensus on the definition of the hyper-parameters for the ML model. During the model building process, each individual training participant should not be able to view the raw training data or infer the information of training data belonging to other contributors. After building the model, the trained ML model should be shared among all the data contributors.\nIn the privacy-preserving aspect, training data is opaque to any participants who are not the data owner and no one, except the owner, is able to inspect the original training data. However, malicious training data contributors can exploit and abuse such non-transparent training style to feed poisoned/mislabeled training data into the training data supply chains and implant backdoors into the ML model. Consequently, the malicious data contributors may influence and drift the final ML model's output to their own intended direction for their own benefit or to the detriment of legitimate data contributors. Once model users encounter erroneous outputs of the trained ML model at runtime, such privacy setting can obstruct the model debugging and forensic process from backtracking the responsible \u201cbad\u201d training data and analyzing the linkage to the corresponding data contributor(s), thus raising concerns regarding model accountability.\nRecently, Shokri et al., \u201cPrivacy-Preserving Deep Learning,\u201d Proceedings of the 22nd ACM CCS, 2015, have proposed a privacy preserving deep learning framework for collaborative training with differential privacy guarantee. Participants can train independently with their own dataset locally and selectively share subsets of their model parameters during training. Parameters can also be obfuscated via differential privacy to defeat privacy attacks. However, their approach lacks the capabilities of verifying legitimate data sources and tracking the provenance of training data. Thus, this approach is still vulnerable to data poisoning attacks launched by either training infrastructure providers or data contributors. Ohrimenko et al., \u201cObvious Multi-Party Machine Learning on Trusted Processors,\u201d USENX Security Symposium, 2016 proposed a mechanism to leverage Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to enable multi-party collaborative training for different machine learning methods, including neural networks. Ohrimenko et al. focused on the design of data-oblivious machine learning algorithms, but did not cover the model accountability issue in the privacy-preserving setting. In addition, due to the performance and memory constraints of SGX enclaves, their approach is not applicable to train large-scale deep learning models.\nTo address the limitations of existing privacy-preserving training approaches, such as Shokri et al. and Ohrimenko et al., the illustrative embodiments provide a secure-trusted execution environment-based deep learning training system that achieves the goals of preserving training data privacy, denying poisoned data from illegitimate data sources, and generating accountable models, i.e. also referred to as a deep learning \u201cmodel\u201d. With the mechanisms of the illustrative embodiments, participants are permitted to provision encrypted training data into the training infrastructure. A trusted execution environment (TEE), e.g., the Protected Execution Facility for IBM Power Systems, Secure Service Containers for IBM Z Systems, Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), ARM TrustZone, AMD Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization, or the like, is employed on training computing devices to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of training data. To bridge the memory and performance gaps of the TEE, a partitioned deep learning pipeline training infrastructure is utilized in which the deep learning pipeline is partitioned into a FrontNet subnet model that executes within the secure TEE, and a BackNet subnet model that executes outside the TEE and can take advantage of various acceleration mechanisms. The mechanisms of the illustrative embodiments also enforce data authentication and verification within the TEE to deny training data from unregistered data channels, e.g., data injected by training infrastructure providers, which are not supposed to feed data into the training pipeline.\nIn addition, the mechanisms of the illustrative embodiments provide a fingerprint mechanism for all training data instances from legitimate channels to build accountable deep learning models. Mechanisms are provided to ensure that such fingerprints cannot be reconstructed to reveal the original training data, but can still assist debugging incorrect outputs at runtime and identify the influential (poisoned or mislabeled) training data and their corresponding contributors.\nThus, the illustrative embodiments, in addressing the confidentiality and integrity problems of delegated/collaborative training, provide a verifiable deep learning training service that leverages trusted execution environments on cloud infrastructures. Users only need to provision encrypted training data to the verifiable deep learning training service provider, which guarantees the confidentiality of their training data via the mechanisms of a trusted execution environment (TEE) and the authentication and verification mechanisms provided therein. Any poisoned or mislabeled training data that may attempt to be injected into the training of the deep learning pipeline (or machine learning (ML) model) is discarded by these authentication and verification mechanisms prior to being used to train the deep learning pipeline. This ensures the integrity of the trained deep learning pipelines (ML model). Moreover, any poised or mislabeled training data may be traced back to the source using the fingerprinting mechanisms of the illustrative embodiments, as described hereafter.\nThe illustrative embodiments partition deep learning pipelines, or ML models, comprising one or more models, into a FrontNet subnet model, or \u201cFrontNet\u201d, and a BackNet subnet model, or \u201cBackNet\u201d, based on the structure of the deep learning pipeline or ML models. In some illustrative embodiments, the FrontNet subnet model and BackNet subnet model may be deep neural network models, for example. Mathematically, in some illustrative embodiments, a deep neural network (DNN) can be defined as a function F* that maps the input x to the output y, i.e., y=F*(x; \u03b8), where \u03b8 stands for the parameters that are learned in the training phase when training the DNN. The function F* is composed of n (assuming the network has n layers) sub-functions Di where i\u2208[1, n]. F1 maps the input xi to the output yi on Layer i. These sub-functions are connected in a chain. Thus, y=F*(x; \u03b8)=FnFn-1 . . . F1(x). After partitioning the DNN at the m-th layer where m\u2208[1, n], the function for the FrontNet subnet model can be represented as \u03a6: X\u2192IR. X is the input space applicable for a specific deep neural network and IR is the output space for the intermediate representations (IRs). IR=\u03a6(x; \u03b8\u03a6)=FmFm\u22121 . . . F1(x) and its output IR is the intermediate representation (intermediate feature maps) computed out of the FrontNet subnet model. The function y* for the BackNet subnet model is \u03bb(IR; \u03b8\u03bb)=FnFn-1 . . . Fm+1(IR), in which IR is the input to the BackNet subnet model from the FrontNet subnet model.\nAs defined above, the representation function for a FrontNet subnet model is IR=\u03a6(x; \u03b8\u03a6) and a BackNet is y*=\u03bb(\u03a6(x; \u03b8\u03a6); \u03b8\u03bb). The parameter \u03b8 of the original DNN is divided into \u03b8\u03a6 and \u03b8\u03bb according to the network partition. The output shape of a FrontNet subnet model is compatible with the input shape of its corresponding BackNet subnet model. IR is delivered as an output for the FrontNet subnet model and is an input to the subsequent BackNet subnet model which continues the computation to get a result y*. Given the same input x, it is expected that y* should be equivalent to y, which is the output of the original DNN before the partition.\nIn accordance with the illustrative embodiments, the training operation for training a deep learning pipeline, or machine learning (ML) model, is also split into FrontNet subnet model training and BackNet subnet model training. The FrontNet subnet model training is executed in an isolated trusted execution environment (TEE) with memory access control and encryption enforcement. The users only need to provision encrypted training data to the training service providers. Thus, no one other than the end users can inspect the content of the training data outside of the TEE. The processes running inside of the TEE authenticate the source of the training data, decrypt the encrypted training data, and verify its validity. Any poisoned training data will be discarded by checking the data authenticity, whereas the authentic and valid training data will be used to train the deep learning pipeline, or ML model. A stochastic gradient descent, for example, may be used for the deep learning training, and back-propagation gradients may be used to update the weights in the FrontNet subnet model and BackNet subnet model of the deep learning pipeline, e.g., the weights of the corresponding nodes in the neural networks. After reaching a desired accuracy of the deep learning pipeline or ML model, e.g., a minimization of the loss function or convergence of the training, both the FrontNet subnet model and BackNet subnet model are stored as the trained model and released back to the user.\nWith the protection of the training data access control mechanisms and training data encryption/decryption mechanisms of the TEE, all non-TEE accesses from privileged system software or other untrusted components of systems will be denied and any poisoned or mislabeled training data will be discarded and potentially traced back to its source using the fingerprinting mechanisms of the illustrative embodiments. Thus, the training processes and unencrypted original training data provided by the various training data sources for training the FrontNet subnet are kept within the perimeter of a specific TEE and are invisible to the external world. Furthermore, the TEE can attest to remote parties (i.e., the end users of the cloud training services) that the FrontNet subnet model is running in a secure environment hosted by a trusted hardware platform.\nAs noted above, in order to protect the contents of training data supplied by end users from being exposed on cloud servers, end users may encrypt the training data with their symmetric keys and upload the encrypted files to the verifiable deep learning training services of the illustrative embodiments. After finishing the remote attestation with the TEE executing on the verifiable deep learning training service computing device(s), end users can provision the symmetric keys to the TEE via a secure communication channel. The mechanisms executing within the TEE, after authenticating received training data, then decrypt the training data and pass the decrypted training data, potentially after data augmentation, to the FrontNet subnet model for training. The illustrative embodiments may leverage an authenticated encryption mechanism, such as the Galois Counter Mode (GCM) for example, or any of a variety of other authenticated encryption mechanisms, to achieve authenticated encryption. Thus, the illustrative embodiments can authenticate legitimate training data contributors and render service abusing attacks ineffective. For adversaries who are attempting to inject a backdoor into the training of the deep learning pipeline via poisoned or mislabeled training data, they would need to encrypt their training data with the proper symmetric keys from the legitimate training data contributors. Assuming that training data contributors' keys are not leaked, the illustrative embodiments can discard this illegitimate training data that fails the authentication and/or integrity check and prevent the introduction of poisoned or mislabeled training data into the training processes of the deep learning pipeline.\nIt should be appreciated that the above process may be performed using a plurality of training datasets from a plurality of training data contributors in a collaborative manner to perform collaborative training of the FrontNet and BackNet subnet models, where the training of the FrontNet subnet model is secured within the TEE while the BackNet subnet model only receives intermediate representations (IRs) that are not able to be used to recreate the original training data. As such, the encryption keys and training data for each training data contributor or training dataset source are maintained secure within the TEE and are not accessible by others outside the TEE, i.e. the original training data is only accessible to the data owners and not to other parties involved in the collaborative training. Hence, a collaborative training is achieved without exposing each training data contributor's original training data.\nWhile the protections afforded by the mechanisms of the illustrative embodiments within the TEE protect the training process of a deep learning pipeline, or ML model, from illegitimate training data from unregistered sources, these mechanisms may not be able to prevent poisoned or mislabeled data from legitimate, or registered, sources which may be malicious or negligent. To address these issues, the illustrative embodiments provide a fingerprint mechanism that records evidential features for each training data instance, where these evidential features, in some illustrative embodiments, include a fingerprint of a specific training instance, a class label of a training data instance, an identifier of the data source, and a hash digest of the training data instance. The fingerprint mechanism is able to provide a tracing capability to trace not only the source of potentially poisoned or mislabeled training data, but also identify the particular training dataset in which the poisoned or mislabeled training data is present.\nBefore beginning the discussion of the various aspects of the illustrative embodiments, it should first be appreciated that throughout this description the term \u201cmechanism\u201d will be used to refer to elements of the present invention that perform various operations, functions, and the like.
