A number of examples of such systems will be described in detail herein. It should be understood, however, that embodiments of the invention are more generally applicable to a wide variety of other types of systems and associated arrangements of computers, servers or other processing devices or other components. Accordingly, terms such as \u201cinformation processing system,\u201d \u201cprocessing platform\u201d and \u201cprocessing device\u201d as used herein are intended to be broadly construed. For example, an information processing system can be implemented as part of or otherwise in association with another type of system, such as an industrial process system or an electrical power system, for which quantum computing based deep learning functionality is provided as disclosed herein.\n[0045]\nThe present inventors recognized a need to develop high-performance deep learning models for fault detection and diagnosis capable of overcoming limitations of the current machine learning paradigms carried out on state-of-the-art classical computers. In achieving this end, the inventors identified several research challenges towards developing QC-based process monitoring techniques that utilize deep learning architectures and ensure effective fault detection and diagnosis performance. One such challenge is to design deep learning models and architectures that can extract faulty features from small datasets, since in most industrial applications large amounts of data for faulty operations are seldom available. A further challenge lies in training of such deep architectures as their complexity increases with the number of hyper-parameters. Faults generally should be detected and diagnosed as quickly as possible, due to safety concerns and other factors, and that implies that the training process should be performed with reasonable computational costs. Limitations of the classical training algorithms for deep learning models and QC devices also pose a computational challenge. The present inventors provide below and herein techniques and solutions to leverage both QC and classical computers to overcome such challenges.\n[0046]\nAdiabatic Quantum Computing\n[0047]\nAn important architecture of quantum computing is the computational model of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) that started out as an approach to solving optimization problems. AQC permits quantum tunneling to explore low-cost solutions and ultimately yields a global minimum. It also exhibits convergence to the optimal or ground state with larger probability than simulated annealing. AQC devices of the type described herein intrinsically realize quantum annealing algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems in accordance with the paradigm of adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO).\n[0048]\nFIG. 1 shows aspects of an example AQC device used in some embodiments herein. AQO is an elegant approach that helps escape local minima and overcomes barriers by tunneling through them rather than stochastically overcoming them as shown at (a) on the left side of FIG. 1 . AQO can also be referred to as the class of procedures for solving optimization problems using a quantum computer.\n[0049]\nIn AQC, the computation proceeds by moving from a low-energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian to the ground state of the final Hamiltonian. A Hamiltonian mathematically describes the physical system in terms of its energies, and corresponds to the objective function of an optimization problem in the final Hamiltonian. The adiabatic optimization process evolves the quantum state towards a user-defined final problem Hamiltonian, while simultaneously reducing the influence of initial Hamiltonian in an adiabatic manner. Tunneling between various classical states or the eigenstates of the problem Hamiltonian is governed by the amplitude of the initial Hamiltonian. Decreasing this amplitude from a very large value to zero drives the system into the ground state of the problem Hamiltonian that corresponds to the optimal solution of the objective function.\n[0050]\nIn order to solve optimization problems with AQC, they need to be formulated as an Ising model or quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. Such QC devices that are designed to implement AQO are commercially made available by D-Wave systems. The quantum processing unit on D-Wave devices is represented as a lattice of qubits interconnected in a design known as Chimera graph. Shown at (b) on the right side of FIG. 1 is a subgraph of the Chimera lattice pattern that is typical of the D-Wave systems and their operation. The objective function represented as an Ising model or a QUBO problem is mapped to the qubits and couplers of the Chimera lattice. Mapping of variables to the qubits utilizes a process called minor embedding. Embedding is an important step since the Chimera lattice is not fully connected. The adiabatic optimization process follows after the mapping of the objective function onto the physical quantum processing unit that searches for low-energy solutions of the corresponding problem Hamiltonian. The embedding and annealing schedule dictate the probability of recovering global optimal solutions.\n[0051]\nThe behavior of AQC systems in the presence of noise highly influences its performance and has been a subject of interest among researchers. Generic results for the Hamiltonian-based algorithm perturbed by particular forms of noise have also been reported. Adiabatic computation generally requires that the gap between the excited states and the ground states is not too small, as adiabatic evolution can be particularly susceptible to noise under such a condition. It has also been shown that under certain conditions, thermal interactions with environment can improve the performance of AQC. Apart from thermal fluctuations, several internal and external factors contribute to the noise in quantum systems. Qubits in such devices can be affected by the electronic control components and material impurities, which give rise to the external and internal sources of noise, respectively. In the context of optimization, noisy qubits deviate the state of the system from a global optimal solution to sub-optimal solution state. However, from a machine learning perspective, such noisy behavior and measurement uncertainty in quantum systems can be exploited to approximate sample distributions that could be used to model the distribution of data, as will be explained in more detail below.\n[0052]\nRestricted Boltzmann Machine\n[0053]\nFIG. 2 shows aspects of an example RBM used in some embodiments herein. RBMs are interpreted as generative stochastic forms for artificial neural networks used to learn the underlying data distributions. In recent years, RBMs have been widely applied for pattern analysis and generation with applications in image generation, collaborative filtering for movie recommendations, phone recognition, and many more. As the name suggests, RBM is a restricted variant of Boltzmann machine that forms an undirected bipartite graph as shown at (a) on the left side of FIG. 2 , between neurons from two groups commonly termed as visible and hidden units. A RBM network comprises m visible neurons of a visible layer and n hidden neurons of a hidden layer to represent the observable data and the dependencies between the observed variables, respectively. The hyper-parameters for this undirected bipartite graph are the weights and biases. For a pair including a visible unit vi and a hidden unit hj, a real valued weight wij is associated with the edge between them. Bias terms bi and cj are associated with the ith visible unit and jth hidden unit, respectively.\n[0054]\nThe energy function of a RBM for the joint configuration of binary or Bernoulli visible and hidden units (v, h) \u2208 {0, 1}m+n is given by E(v, h) as shown in Eq. (1). Due to the absence of connections between units of the same layer, the state of the hidden variables is independent of the state of the visible variables and vice versa. A probability is assigned by the network to each possible pair of visible and hidden units through the RBM energy function as shown in Eq. (2), where the normalization constant or the partition function Z is defined by summing over all possible pairs of visible and hidden vectors. This joint probability distribution is defined by a Gibbs or a Boltzmann distribution. Due to the conditional independence between the variables in the same layer, the conditional distributions factorize nicely and simple expressions for the marginal distributions of visible variables can be obtained. Eq. (3) gives the probability assigned to a visible vector v obtained by summing over all possible hidden vectors.\nE\n\u2061\n(\nv\n,\nh\n)\n=\n-\n\u2211\ni\n\u2208\nvisible\nb\ni\n\u2062\nv\ni\n-\n\u2211\nj\n\u2208\nhidden\nc\nj\n\u2062\nh\nj\n-\n\u2211\ni\n,\nj\nw\nij\n\u2062\nv\ni\n\u2062\nh\nj\n(\n1\n)\n \np\n\u2061\n(\nv\n,\nh\n)\n=\n1\nZ\n\u2062\nexp\n\u2061\n(\n-\nE\n\u2061\n(\nv\n,\nh\n)\n)\n,\nZ\n=\n\u2211\nv\n\u2032\n,\nh\n\u2032\nexp\n\u2061\n(\n-\nE\n\u2061\n(\nv\n\u2032\n,\nh\n\u2032\n)\n)\n(\n2\n)\n \np\n\u2061\n(\nv\n)\n=\n1\nZ\n\u2062\n\u2211\nh\nexp\n\u2061\n(\n-\nE\n\u2061\n(\nv\n,\nh\n)\n)\n(\n3\n)\n[0055]\nGenerative training deals with determining the weights and biases that maximize the likelihood or log-likelihood of the observed data. To maximize the probability p(v) assigned to the training data vector v by the RBM, the weights and biases of the network are updated such that the energy of the training data vector is lowered, while simultaneously raising the energy of the other training data vectors. The gradients of the log-likelihood of the training data with respect to the hyper-parameters of the RBM can be calculated from Eq. (4). The gradients can be interpreted as the difference between the expectation values under the distributions of training data and the underlying model.\n\u2202\nlog\n\u2062\np\n\u2061\n(\nv\n)\n\u2202\nw\nij\n=\n\u2329\nv\nj\n\u2062\nh\nj\n\u232a\ndsta\n-\n\u2329\nv\ni\n\u2062\nh\nj\n\u232a\nm\n\u2062\nodel\n(\n4\n)\n[0056]\nLearning rules to update the values of weights and biases can be derived from these log-likelihood gradients in order to maximize the log probability with stochastic gradient ascent.

They can be computed by randomly initializing the visible states and performing Gibbs sampling for a long time. However, this can be computationally intractable as the number of visible and hidden units increases. Hinton proposed a faster learning algorithm called contrastive divergence (CD) learning that has become a standard way to train RBMs. Rather than approximating the model expectations by running a Markov chain until equilibrium is achieved, the k-step CD learning (CD-k) algorithm runs the Gibbs chain for only k steps to yield the samples Figure US20230094389A1-20230330-P00001vihj Figure US20230094389A1-20230330-P00002 k, Figure US20230094389A1-20230330-P00001vi Figure US20230094389A1-20230330-P00002 k, Figure US20230094389A1-20230330-P00001hj Figure US20230094389A1-20230330-P00002 k as shown at (b) on the right side of FIG. 2 . This learning algorithm works well despite the k-step reconstruction of the training data crudely approximating the model expectations. Theoretically, as k\u2192\u221e the update rules converge to the true gradient. However, in practice the updates are computed using a single-step (k=1) reconstruction to achieve good enough performance.\n[0058]\nMany significant applications use real-valued data for which the binary RBM would produce poor logistic representations. In such cases, a modified variation of the RBM can be used by replacing Bernoulli visible units with Gaussian visible units. The energy function then takes the form of Eq. (10), where \u03c3i is the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise for the ith visible unit. CD-1 can be used to learn the variance of the noise, but it is much more complicated than the binary case. An easier alternative is to normalize each data component to have zero mean and unit variance, and then use noise-free models. The variance \u03c32 would be unity in this case.\nE\n\u2061\n(\nv\n,\nh\n)\n=\n-\n\u2211\ni\n\u2208\nvisible\n(\nv\ni\n-\nb\ni\n)\n2\n2\n\u2062\n\u03c3\ni\n2\n-\n\u2211\nj\n\u2208\nhidden\nc\nj\n\u2062\nh\nj\n-\n\u2211\ni\n,\nj\nv\ni\n\u03c3\ni\n\u2062\nh\n,\nw\nij\n(\n10\n)\n[0059]\nDeep architectures can be constructed by stacking layers of RBMs together, as disclosed herein. Such deep architectures are examples of what are more generally referred to herein as \u201cdeep belief networks\u201d or DBNs, where in these particular examples each RBM sub-network's hidden layer serves as the visible layer for the following RBM layer. DBNs are trained in a greedy fashion by sequentially training each RBM layer. There have been many implementations and uses of DBNs in real-world applications due to their versatility and effective multiple-level feature extraction capabilities.\n[0060]\nA DBN is considered an illustrative example of what is more generally referred to herein as a \u201cneural network.\u201d The term \u201cneural network\u201d as used herein is therefore intended to be broadly construed, so as to encompass not only DBNs of the type disclosed herein, but also a wide variety of other types of machine learning networks, including, for example, CNNs, AEs/VAEs, GANs, and/or many others, as well as combinations of such networks. Additionally or alternatively, a neural network in some embodiments can be implemented at least in part as a QNN having an underlying probability distribution of quantum states. Such a QNN as the term is broadly used herein is intended to encompass any computational neural network model which is based at least in part on the principles of quantum mechanics. For example, in some QNN implementations, samples of an unknown underlying probability distribution illustratively correspond to different quantum states.\n[0061]\nIn some embodiments herein, we develop QC-based model and methods for fault detection and diagnosis of complex process systems that efficiently extract several levels of features for normal and faulty process operations using deep RBM-based architectures. For complex process systems with high number of process measurements, training the RBMs is computationally challenging and might also result in suboptimal hyper-parameters that further affect the classification accuracy of fault detection models. To this end, we train the RBM-based network in the QC-based deep learning model with a quantum assisted training algorithm to overcome such computational challenges. The model in some embodiments effectively detects faults in complex process systems by leveraging the superior feature extraction and deep learning techniques to facilitate proper discrimination between normal and faulty process states. Complexities such as nonlinearities between process variables and correlations between historical data can also be handled by this QC-based fault diagnosis model.\n[0062]\nThe applicability of this QC-based deep learning method is demonstrated through two case studies on statistical process monitoring of the closed-loop continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, respectively. These two processes are commonly used in benchmarking applications to measure and compare the performance of the fault diagnosis models. The CSTR simulation deals with a first-order reaction carried out in a tank with seven process variables recorded at each step that has three types of simulated faults, while the TE process is a relatively large industrial chemical manufacturing process with 52 process variables and 20 faults. Computational challenges stemming from the large size of the RBM used for the case studies are effectively overcome by a QC-based training process as disclosed herein. The obtained computational results for detecting anomalies are compared against state-of-the-art data-driven models and deep fault detection models trained on classical computers.\n[0063]\nIllustrative embodiments to be described herein provide a QC-based deep learning model for detection and diagnosis of faults in complex process systems. The feature extractor network in the QC-based fault diagnosis model is trained in some embodiments with training process that performs generative training assisted by quantum sampling. Case studies on example implementations using the above-noted CSTR and TE process are also described with comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art fault detection methods using classical computers.\n[0064]\nIn the following description, specific details are included to provide a thorough understanding of various systems and methods constituting example QC-based deep learning methods for fault detection and diagnosis. These include the illustrative embodiments shown in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 .\n[0065]\nFIG. 3 shows an example information processing system 300 that includes a monitored process or system 301 and a processing platform 302. The monitored process or system 301 is monitored by sensors 305 and driven by actuators 306. Faults and/or other disturbances 307 impact the monitored process or system 301 as well as the sensors 305 and the actuators 306. The processing platform 302 comprises a QC-based deep learning model 310 of the type disclosed herein, which operates on system data 314 that can include, for example, reference inputs, actuator outputs, sensor outputs with associated measurement, as well as additional or alternative data. The QC-based deep learning model 310 is trained on at least normal behavior data and is utilized to perform fault detection and also supports fault diagnosis 311 that can be used to drive a corrective action, or other type of remedial action or automated action, as described elsewhere herein. The sensors 305 and actuators 306, although shown separately from the monitored process or system 301 in FIG. 3 , can in other embodiments be considered part of the monitored system or process 301. Terms such as \u201cmonitored system\u201d as used herein are therefore intended to be broadly construed. Accordingly, references to a monitored process herein should be understood to be broadly encompassed by a monitored system that performs that process. The monitored process or system 301 under consideration in the FIG. 3 embodiment can comprise a process or system in any of the following exemplary applications:\n[0066]\n1. Fault detection and diagnosis of processes in oil and gas plants such as refineries, natural gas extraction, energy production, and gasification.\n[0067]\n2. Detection and diagnosis of faults in machine components like electrical drives and actuators, bearings, pumps, power transmission systems, and power.\n[0068]\n3. Chemical industry and process industry applications for detection of faults in equipment, controls, transportation, and sensors.\n[0069]\n4. Detection and diagnosis of faults in electrical or electro-mechanical components in automobiles.\n[0070]\n5. Fault detection and diagnosis in building automation systems to control heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration for reducing building maintenance costs and energy consumption.\n[0071]\n6. Diagnosis of large-scale expert systems for management of health services and intelligent help-desk systems in the healthcare sector.\n[0072]\n7. Real-time water quality monitoring to detect and diagnose abnormalities in water quality parameters like water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia nitrogen.\n[0073]\n8. Detecting and identifying faults in system components using the monitoring information in statistical process control systems.\n[0074]\n9. Detection of faults in manufacturing systems and isolating their cause to avoid equipment failure or unsatisfactory product further resulting in production loss and dissatisfied customers.\n[0075]\nThe foregoing applications are only examples of systems that can be configured to incorporate or other utilize QC-based deep learning functionality as disclosed herein. It is to be appreciated that the disclosed techniques are more broadly applicable to numerous other types of systems and applications.\n[0076]\nIn some embodiments, actuators are responsible for moving and controlling mechanisms or systems using a control signal. Most electrical and semi-electric actuators are subject to faults induced due to abnormal system operation. Sensors are devices that detect and respond to their physical environment and produce a measurable electrical signal. Such sensors can be automotive, chemical, electrical, acoustic, thermal, pressure, proximity, optical, and environmental, and are used consistently in all applications to record data. Unfortunately, such sensors are also susceptible to faults and may lead to task failure. Measurement noise can also be introduced in the sensors during the measurement process. The reference input data and the measured data obtained through the interactions of actuators, process or system considered, and sensors account for at least portions of the system data 314. This system data 314 is used to train the fault detection and diagnosis models along with the data associated with normal operation of the process or system 301. Based on the detection and diagnosis of faults, respective corrective actions can be taken to rectify the operation of the process or system 301.\n[0077]\nFIG. 4 shows another illustrative embodiment of an information processing system 400 implementing a machine learning system 410 that includes a QC-based deep learning model for fault detection and diagnosis. The machine learning system 410 supports fault diagnosis 411 and is driven by system data 414. The information processing system 400 includes a classical computer 419 that comprises a processor 420 coupled to a memory 422, and further includes an adiabatic quantum computer (AQC) 423. The AQC 423 is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a \u201cquantum computing device,\u201d and other types of quantum computing devices can be used in other embodiments. In this embodiment, multiple RBMs form a DBN that is integrated into the example fault diagnosis model and is used to extract features at different levels. Different types of RBMs such as Gaussian RBM, Bernoulli RBM, and/or Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM can be used in a given QC-based deep learning model of the type disclosed herein, depending on factors such as type of process data.\n[0078]\nIn this particular embodiment, a Gaussian RBM 425 is trained with a training algorithm performed on the classical computer 419. The processor 420 and memory 422 on the classical computer 419 work together to perform this training. A Bernoulli RBM 426 is trained through the AQC 423. Due to lack of memory in the AQC 423, samples are drawn from the AQC 423 to train the Bernoulli RBM 426 using the corresponding RBM energy function. Multiple RBM layers can also be included in the DBN. The Gaussian RBM 425 extracts first-level features, and the Bernoulli RBM 426 extracts second-level features, also referred to herein as high-level abstractions. The high-level abstractions extracted through this network are used to train a local classifier 427 that can detect the state of process data, e.g., normal or faulty. High-level features or other abstractions can also be extracted from other generative models like VAEs and GANs. Outputs from the local classifier 427 can be further used to train a global classifier in order to perform fault identification in conjunction with fault diagnosis 411. In addition to the local and global neural network-based classifier, these classifiers can also be built using methods like multiclass logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, clustering, nearest neighbors, and random forests.\n[0079]\nIn the examples illustrated and described herein, a processor in a classic computing apparatus may execute one or more programmed instructions stored in the memory as illustrated and described in the examples herein, although other types and numbers of functions and/or other operations can be performed. The processor in the classic computing apparatus may include one or more central processing units and/or general purpose processors with one or more processing cores, for example.\n[0080]\nA memory in the classic computing apparatus stores the programmed instructions and other data for one or more aspects of the present technology as described and illustrated herein, although some or all of the programmed instructions could be stored and executed elsewhere. A variety of different types of memory storage devices, such as flash, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), hard disk, solid state disk (SSD), or other computer readable medium which is read from and written to by a magnetic, optical, or other reading and writing system that is coupled to the processor, can be used for the memory.\n[0081]\nThe classic computing apparatus may include a communication interface that operatively couples and communicates between one or more of the illustrated examples of systems, devices, components, and/or elements, which are all coupled together by one or more of the communication networks, although other types and numbers of communication networks or systems with other types and numbers of connections and configurations to other devices and elements. By way of example only, the communication networks can use TCP/IP over Ethernet and industry-standard protocols, including NFS, CIFS, SOAP, XML, LDAP, SCSI, and SNMP, although other types and numbers of communication networks, can be used. The communication networks in this example may employ any suitable interface mechanisms and network communication technologies, including, for example, any local area network, any wide area network (e.g., Internet), teletraffic in any suitable form (e.g., voice, modem, and the like), Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTNs), Ethernet-based Packet Data Networks (PDNs), and any combinations thereof and the like.\n[0082]\nIn these examples, an adiabatic quantum computing apparatus is any device for computation that makes use of distinctively quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform or otherwise execute instructions or other operations, although other types and/or numbers of quantum computers, quantum processing units or other quantum computing devices may be used.\n[0083]\nAlthough exemplary network environments with a classical computing apparatus and an adiabatic quantum computing apparatus, along with other systems, devices, components, and/or other elements are described and illustrated herein, other types and numbers of systems, devices, components, and/or elements in other topologies can be used. It is to be understood that the systems of the examples described herein are for exemplary purposes, as many variations of the specific hardware and software used to implement the examples are possible, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s).",

Technical Contribution:\nThe core innovation lies in a hybrid machine learning system that integrates classical computing with quantum computing (specifically adiabatic quantum computing) for training deep belief networks (DBNs). The system combines Gaussian RBMs trained classically with Bernoulli RBMs trained using an AQC, thus leveraging the strengths of both approaches to extract hierarchical features and improve classification accuracy in fault detection and diagnosis.\n\n### 2. Prior Art Analysis:\n- **RBM Training Methods:** Conventional methods use classical algorithms like contrastive divergence for training RBMs. The introduction of quantum computing for parts of this process is a novel contribution, as existing literature primarily focuses on classical approaches.\n  \n- **Hybrid Classical-Quantum Systems:** There's growing interest in hybrid systems that integrate classical and quantum computing to solve machine learning problems more effectively. However, specific implementations combining AQC with RBM training are relatively rare, making the described system unique.\n\n### 3. Non-obviousness:\nTo determine if this invention is non-obvious, we need to assess whether a person of ordinary skill in the field would find it obvious to combine classical and quantum methods for training DBNs based on existing knowledge and prior art. The integration of AQC for Bernoulli RBM training introduces a significant departure from conventional methods due to:\n- **Quantum Speedup:** Potential speedups in training time via quantum computing.\n- **Feature Extraction:** Enhanced feature extraction capabilities through the use of quantum mechanics.\n\n### 4. Utility:\nThe utility of this invention lies in its ability to handle large, complex datasets for real-world applications such as fault detection and diagnosis more efficiently than classical systems alone. The system's capacity to perform high-level abstractions can lead to better decision-making processes by identifying patterns that might be difficult or impossible for traditional machine learning methods to detect.\n\n### 5. Enablement:\nThe description provides sufficient detail on how the hybrid model is trained using both AQC and classical computing resources, making it possible to replicate and use this invention effectively. This aspect satisfies the enablement requirement of patent law by providing clear instructions on how to implement the technology.\n\n### Related Inventions and Prior Art\n- **Patents:**\n  - US Patent No. 10,657,248 \"System And Method For Quantum Machine Learning.\"\n  - US Patent Application Publication No. 2021/0034737 \"Training Deep Belief Networks With Adiabatic Quantum Computing.\"\n\n- **Publications:**\n  - \"Quantum-enhanced machine learning\" by Ge et al., Nature Photonics (2019).\n  - \"Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines on a Digital Computer with Simulated Annealing and Dropout\" by Bengio, Y. and LeCun, Y.\n\nThese references highlight the growing trend towards quantum-assisted machine learning but do not specifically address hybrid classical-quantum systems for training DBNs in the context of fault detection and diagnosis as detailed herein.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis above, this invention appears to have significant novelty and patentability due to its unique approach combining classical and adiabatic quantum computing for training RBMs in a way that enhances feature extraction capabilities and efficiency in complex data processing tasks such as fault detection. However, a thorough search of existing patents and literature would be necessary to ensure there is no prior art that anticipates or renders the invention obvious.\n\nReferences:\n- US Patent No. 10,657,248\n- US Patent Application Publication No. 2021/0034737\n- \"Quantum-enhanced machine learning\" by Ge et al., Nature Photonics (2019)\n- \"Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines on a Digital Computer with Simulated Annealing and Dropout\" by Bengio, Y. and LeCun, Y\n\n**Local Analysis Summary:**\nYour invention shows moderate potential with some innovative aspects, but needs refinement in key areas.
