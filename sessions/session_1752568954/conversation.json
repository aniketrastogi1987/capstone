      "user_query": "A model fusion triple representation learning system and method based on deep learning\n\u3010Technical field\u3011\n\nThe invention belongs to the field of electronic information technology and relates to a model fusion triple representation learning system and method based on deep learning.\n\n\u3010Background technique\u3011\n\nPeople usually organize the knowledge in the knowledge base in the form of a network. Each node in the network represents an entity (name of person, place name, organization name, concept, etc.), and each edge represents the relationship between entities. Therefore, most knowledge can often be represented by a triplet (entity 1, relationship, entity 2), corresponding to an edge in the knowledge base network and the two entities it connects. This is a common representation of knowledge bases. For example, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) technical standard released by the World Wide Web (W3C) is based on triple representation. Knowledge base is an important basic technology that promotes the development of artificial intelligence disciplines and supports intelligent information service applications (such as intelligent search, intelligent question and answer, personalized recommendations, etc.). In order to improve the quality of information services, domestic and foreign Internet companies (especially search engine companies) have launched knowledge base products, such as Google Knowledge Graph, Microsoft Bing Satori, Baidu Zhixin, and Sogou Zhicube. After Google proposed the concept of knowledge graphs, the form of representing knowledge in a triplet structure has been widely recognized. The knowledge graph was also born from this.\n\nThe essence of the knowledge graph is a collection of triples. However, the completeness of the triples obtained after the entity relationship extraction is completed is still insufficient. Currently, large-scale knowledge graphs such as Freebase, Wikidata, DBpedia, etc., which store a large number of triples, exist. But they are still far from complete. With the explosive growth of information, it is certain that the knowledge map exists, but it is still far from complete. With the explosive growth of information, determining the correctness of the information in triples and completing them are also crucial tasks.\n\nTriplet representation learning based on deep learning is currently mainly divided into three categories: distance-based, text fusion and path-based methods. The translation-based representation learning completion model obtains the representation of entity and relationship semantic information by embedding entities and relationships into a low-dimensional vector space. After the word2vec word representation learning toolkit was proposed in 2013, through this model, the translation-invariant phenomenon existing in the word vector space was found. For example, V(father)-V(mother)=V(female)-V(male), where V(w) represents the vector representation of word w learned with word2vec. That is, the word vector representation can capture some of the same semantic relationships implicit between the words father and mother, and between female and male. And with the help of analogical reasoning experiments, we found that this phenomenon widely exists in the semantic relationships and syntactic relationships of words. Inspired by this phenomenon, the TransE model is proposed, which embeds entities and relationships in a low-dimensional space, represents the relationship as an inter-entity translation operation in the low-dimensional embedding space, and then uses the score function to connect the entities and relationships, and performs the operation through the loss function. Optimize to obtain the optimal target value. Since then, most translation-based representation learning models have been extended on the basis of TransE. Although the performance has been improved, the overly complex and sophisticated design of the model has greatly affected subsequent scalability. Fusion text representation learning refers to fusing knowledge extracted from different data sources together. Different from traditional data fusion (datafusion) tasks, knowledge fusion technology can use multiple different knowledge extraction tools to extract corresponding values from each data source for each data item, while data fusion only considers a single extraction tool . The drawback and shortcoming is that the noise generated in the process of fusing multi-source data cannot be effectively processed and resolved. Multi-step relationship paths also contain rich reasoning patterns between entities. The model generally measures the reachability of the relationship path through a path constrained resource allocation algorithm, and uses the semantic combination of relationship embedding to represent the relationship path, that is, the relationship path is used as a translation between entities in representation learning. Not only direct relationships are considered, but also multi-step relationship paths containing rich reasoning patterns between entities are considered, solving the problem of representation learning from only a single path. You can also use the information of relationship paths to represent entities and relationships in the knowledge graph. The flaw and shortcoming is that the selection and design of path formulas directly determine the performance of the model, which is insufficient in terms of versatility.",
