Engage with experts in AI and machine learning patent law to validate your findings and provide professional advice regarding the novelty and non-obviousness of your invention.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can comprehensively determine the novelty and patentability of your model fusion triple representation learning system based on deep learning using pre-trained BERT language models.\n\n**Local Analysis Summary:**\nYour invention shows moderate potential with some innovative aspects, but needs refinement in key areas. Consider focusing on unique technical aspects and strengthening the novelty claims.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\u2022 \u2705 Clear and descriptive title with technical specificity\n\u2022 \u274c Abstract needs significant improvement - lacks technical depth and structure\n\u2022 \u2139\ufe0f  No detailed description provided - consider adding technical specifications\n\u2022 \u26a0\ufe0f  Moderate technology potential - consider market positioning\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\u2022 Moderate potential - consider filing within 6-12 months\n\u2022 Improve technical specifications and novelty aspects\n\u2022 Conduct comprehensive prior art search\n\u2022 Expand abstract to include problem statement, solution approach, and benefits\n\n**Acceptance Probability:**\n54.2% (if available)",
