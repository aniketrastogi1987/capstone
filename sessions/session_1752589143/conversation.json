No. 62/476,280, filed Mar. 24, 2017, entitled \u201cLearning Coach for Machine Learning System.\u201d These two provisional applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\nU.S. application Ser. No. 16/891,866, filed Jun. 3, 2020, now U.S. Pat. No. 10,839,294, issued Nov. 17, 2020, also is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/334,204. Additionally, application Ser. No. 17/654,194, filed Mar. 9, 2022, also claims priority to application Ser. No. 17/455,623.\nBACKGROUND\nMachine learning is a process implemented by computers to self-learn algorithms that can make predictions on data through building models from sample data inputs, without being explicitly programmed to do so. There are many types of machine learning system types, such as artificial neural networks (AVNs), decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and others. These systems first have to be trained on some of the sample inputs before making meaningful predictions with new data. For example, an ANN typically consists of multiple layers of neurons. Each neuron is connected with many others, and links can be enforcing or inhibitory in their effect on the activation state of connected neurons. Each individual neural unit may have a summation function which combines the values of all its inputs together. There may be a threshold function or limiting function on each connection and on the neuron itself, such that the signal must surpass the limit before propagating to other neurons. The weight for each respective input to a node can be trained by back propagation of the partial derivative of an error cost function, with the estimates being accumulated over the training data samples. A large, complex ANN can have millions of connections between nodes, and the weight for each connection has to be learned.\nSUMMARY\nIn one general aspect, the present invention is directed to a computer system that comprises one or more \u201cstudent\u201d machine learning systems along with at least one \u201ccoach\u201d machine learning system. The coach machine learning system itself uses machine learning to help the student machine learning system(s). For example, by monitoring a student machine learning system, the coach machine learning system can learn (through machine learning techniques) \u201chyperparameters\u201d for the student machine learning system that control the machine learning process for the student learning system. For example, in the case where the student machine learning system uses a deep neural network (DNN), the learned hyperparameters can include the minibatch size M, the learning rate \u03b7, the regularization parameter \u03bb, and/or the momentum parameter \u03bc. Also, one set of learned hyperparameters could be used to determine all of the weights of the student machine learning system's network, or customized learned hypermeters can be used for different weights in the network. For example, each weight (or other trainable parameter) of the student learning system could have its own set of customized learned hyperparameters that are learned by the learning system coach.\nAdditionally or in lieu of learning the hyperparameters, the machine learning coach could determine structural modifications for the student learning system architecture. For example, where the student learning system uses a DNN, the machine learning coach can modify the structure of the DNN, such as by adding or deleting layers and/or by adding or deleting nodes in layers. Additionally, the student learning system might include an ensemble of machine learning system. The learning coach in such a scenario could control the data flow to the various machine learning systems and/or add members to the ensemble.\nThe student learning system(s) and machine learning coach preferably operate in parallel. That is, the machine learning coach observes the student learning system(s) while the student learning system(s) is/are in the learning process and the machine learning coach makes its changes to the student learning system(s) (e.g., hyperparameters, structural modifications, etc.) while the student learning system(s) is/are in the learning process. The learning coach and the student(s) may be the same or different types of machine learning architectures.\nThe learning coach can have an objective function distinct from the objective of the student learning system(s). For example, the student learning system may minimize the error rate or some other measure of the cost of the errors, while the learning coach makes structural modifications to the student learning system to optimize some combination of the cost of errors and the cost of performing the computation. The learning coach can also make modifications to the student learning system, especially additions, to improve its capabilities while guaranteeing that there will be no degradation in performance.\nThese and other benefits of the present invention are apparent from the description herein.\nFIGURES\nVarious embodiments of the present invention are described herein by way of example in connection with the following figures, wherein:\nFIGS. 1, 14 and 15 are block diagrams of systems that include a student machine learning system and a learning coach according to various embodiments of the present invention;\nFIG. 2 is a block diagram of one process by which the learning coach controls the training of a student learning system according to various embodiments of the present invention;\nFIG. 3 is an illustration of a process according to various embodiments of the present invention by which the learning coach collects observations of the student learning system as the student learning system is being trained;\nFIG. 4 is a block diagram of large learning system with data flow controlled by learning coaches according to various embodiments of the present invention;\nFIG. 5 is a block diagram of the system of FIG. 4 where some of the learning modules are stored in high-speed memory or cache and others are stored in secondary storage according to various embodiments of the present invention;\nFIG. 6 illustrates a process for transferring explicit knowledge to a machine learning network according to various embodiments of the present invention;\nFIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate mechanisms for adding nodes to a learning network according to various embodiments of the present invention;\nFIG. 9 is a flow chart that illustrates a process for creating explicit knowledge according to various embodiments of the present invention;\nFIG. 10 is a block diagram that illustrates a system for making implicit knowledge communicable according to various embodiments of the present invention;\nFIG. 11 is a block diagram of a large machine learning system that share knowledge among machine learning modules of the system according to various embodiments of the present invention;\nFIG. 12 is a block diagram of an ensemble machine learning system where the learning coach controls the distribution of data among ensemble members according to various embodiments of the present invention; and\nFIG. 13 is a block diagram of an ensemble machine learning system where a preliminary classifier controls the distribution of data among ensemble members according to various embodiments of the present invention.\nDESCRIPTION\nFIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system 10 according to a basic embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 1 shows a machine learning system 11 that is being trained to recognize patterns in the data supplied from a data source 21. Since the machine learning system 11 is in the training or learning process, it is also referred to herein as a \u201cstudent.\u201d The system 10 further includes a machine learning system 41 that controls some aspects of the learning process and aids the student machine learning system 11 in its process of learning the patterns. Because it helps that learning process, the machine learning system 41 is called a \u201clearning coach.\u201d\nIn various embodiments, the learning coach 41 is itself a machine learning system. However, the learning coach 41 does not try to recognize the patterns that the student learning system 11 is learning to recognize. The primary data processed by the learning coach 41 are observations 31 of the internal state of the student machine learning system 11 and data that student system 11 computes during its training process. In addition, among the control mechanisms used by the learning coach 41 is the selection of training data for the student 11. Thus, the learning coach 41 may also receive the training data 34 as input, but not for the purpose of recognizing patterns in it, as described herein. The learning coach 41 preferably also has other means of controlling and aiding the learning process of the student 11, including controlling hyperparameters 32 of the student 11 and changing the internal structure 33 of the student machine learning system 11, as described herein.\nFor purpose of discussion, focus first on the controls called \u201chyperparameters.\u201d Generally, any large complex machine learning system, such as the student learning system 11, has a large number of parameters for which good values need to be found to try to minimize some measure of the cost of errors in the pattern recognition process. These are the trainable parameters. Finding these values is the essence of the process called \u201clearning\u201d in a machine learning system. There may be millions or even billions of these parameters, so the learning process may be very time-consuming and expensive. To help the learning process work better, there are usually a few control parameters that tune the learning process to work better on the kind of data for a particular task. These control parameters are not learned by the machine learning system 11, but usually are specified by the system designer. To distinguish them from the parameters being learned by system 11, these control parameters are referred to as \u201chyperparameters\u201d herein; they are parameters that control the learning process of the machine learning system.\nIn embodiments of the present invention, some or all of these hyperparameters are not controlled by the system designer, but rather are controlled be the learning coach 41.\nTo illustrate the use of hyperparameters through an illustrative example, let the student system 11 be a large, deep feed-forward neural network (a DNN), a type of machine learning system that is well known to those skilled in the art of machine learning, A deep neural network is a network that has many layers of nodes representing artificial models of neurons with connections or arcs in the network representing the strength of the connection between the neurons represented by the nodes. Each arc is associated with a numerical value that represents the strength or \u201cweight\u201d of its connection. These weights comprise the parameters to be learned in the training of student system 11. In a large DNN, there may be millions of nodes with billions of connections and, therefore, billions of these connection weights that need to be learned. The individual nodes and arcs can use a greatly simplified, artificial model of a real neuron. The complexity of the learning process for deep neural networks arises from the large number of nodes and arcs and the complexity of their interactions.\nFor purpose of illustration, the use of the hyperparameters for training deep feed forward neural networks will be described. This example is by way of illustration and is not intended as limiting the scope of the invention, as the invention can be applied to any complex machine learning system, including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, CART analysis, hidden stochastic process models, dynamic Bayesian networks, Boltzmann machines, ensembles of any of these and even heterogeneous ensembles. The machine learning system may be complex in any one or more of several ways. It may have a large, complex internal structure; its learning may be controlled by hyperparameters; or its training may be done by a computationally intensive process on a large amount of training data. The illustrative training method is an iterative process of stochastic gradient descent on a log-likelihood error cost function, with a softmax classification for the output nodes, the gradients for each training example being estimated by back propagation of the partial derivative of the error cost function, the estimates being accumulated over minibatches, with one update of the parameters for each minibatch. In the illustrative method, the training process is enhanced by Nesterov's momentum, and smoothed by L2 regularization. Other well-known training methods could be used in a similar way.",
