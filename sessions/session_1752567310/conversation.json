      "user_query": "rning system based on deep learning, including:\n\nThe BERT triple input module is used to serialize triples and embed triples through masked language modeling, and use BERT's own SpecialTokens mechanism to input the descriptive information of triples;\n\nTransE triple input module is used to train triples through the training mechanism of TransE; learn the structural information in triples, and use the distance formula to calculate the similarity between triples to learn entity relationships dependencies between them, thereby generating word vector representations of triples;\n\nThe joint representation learning module is used to combine the BERT triple input module and the TransE triple input module, and combine the two for joint training, and finally obtain the best optimization of triple word vector representation.\n\nThe invention also discloses a model fusion triple representation learning method based on deep learning, which includes the following steps:\n\nStage 0: Data preprocessing\n\nStep 0: Use tools, crowdsourcing or experts to evaluate the data set, remove useless error triple sets, and filter out noisy data that is irrelevant to subsequent work;\n\nStep 1: Given a set of m triples, initialize the word vectors of its x entities and y relationships;\n\nStage 1: Triplet representation learning based on BERT\n\nStep 2: Use the pre-trained language model BERT as the word embedding tool to map each word to the corresponding vector space; use the [SEP] delimiter to separate the three, and each region is independently encoded by position;\n\nStep 3: Use BERT's masked language mode to input triples. The input format is expressed as \"[CLS] Head Entity [SEP] Relationship [SEP] Tail Entity [SEP]\"; calculate the context and evaluation through BERT's multi-head self-attention mechanism Representation of primary interactions between objects:\n\n\nin, represents the input of the i-th word in the sentence, BERT g represents the language model used in the embedding stage, Represents the embedding representation generated by BERT for the i-th word in the sentence;\n\nStep 4: When Bert performs word embedding, he uses an 8-layer Transformer as the basic framework. The Transformer is divided into two stages: multi-head attention and feed-forward layer; the attention is as follows:\n\n(attention output )=Attention (Q, K, V) (2)\n\nMulti-head attention projects Q, K, and V through h different linear transformations. Finally, the different attention results are spliced together. Each head is treated as an independent attention mechanism. A total of e attention calculations are performed, and Attention result splicing:\n\nMultiHead(Q,K,V)=Concat(head 1 ,...,head e )W o (3)\n\nhead i =Attention(QW i O , QW i K , VW i V ) (4)\n\nCalculate using scaleddot-product:\n\n\nAmong them, QK T is used to calculate the similarity between Q matrix and K matrix, square root Used to scale each value in the matrix, the similarity matrix is multiplied by the V matrix to obtain the matrix representation after attention;\n\nStep 5: The head entity h is represented as a sentence containing Tokens, and the relation r is represented as a sentence containing Tokens; for a given Token, its input representation is constructed by adding the corresponding Token, segment and position embeddings; Different elements separated by [SEP] have different segment embeddings. The tokens in the first and last entity sentences have the same segment embedding, while the tokens in the relative sentences have different segment embeddings. Different tokens are in the same position, that is, they have The same embedding position model training is to first build a positivetripleset and a negativetripleset respectively, and then use BERT's [CLS] label to make a sigmoid score:\n\n\nAmong them, the score function s \u03c4 is a two-dimensional real vector with s \u03c40 , s \u03c41 \u2208 [0, 1] and s \u03c40 +s \u03c41 =1;\n\nStep 6: Each input Token has an input representation E i ; the Token representation is input into the BERT model architecture; the final hidden vector of the special [CLS] Token and the i-th input Token is expressed as and/> H represents the size of the hidden state of pre-trained BERT; the final hidden state C corresponding to [CLS] is used as an aggregated sequence representation of the combined triple score; introduced in fine-tuning for (h, r, t) triple classification The only new parameter of is the weight of the classification layer, i.e.\n\nStep 7: Use triple classification to judge whether it is a reasonable triple; divide the input sequence into three parts: head, relationship and tail, and use sep to divide it; set positive and negative samples for training in the training phase, and use BERT's [CLS ] label makes a sigmoid score and the final cross-entropy loss training model finally calculates the cross-entropy loss:\n\n\nAmong them, y \u03c4 \u2208 {0, 1} is the label of the triplet; negative triplet It is generated by replacing the head entity or tail entity of a triplet in the positive triplet (h, r, t) with a random head entity or tail entity;\n\n\nin, is an entity collection; if a triple is already in the positive collection/> , then it will not be regarded as a negative example; the trained parameter weights and the new weight W are updated through the gradient descent method;\n\nStage 2: Triplet representation learning based on translation model TransE\n\nStep 8: Initialize h, r, t in the triplet, during which each iteration update needs to be normalized:\n\n\nAmong them, uniform() is the initialization function, k is the word vector dimension, h, r, t are the head entity, relationship and tail entity respectively;\n\nStep 9: TransE is a distributed vector representation based on entities and relationships. It uses the translation invariance phenomenon of word vectors to regard the relationship r in each triplet instance (h, r, t) as the head entity h to the tail entity. The translation of t, by continuously adjusting the vectors of h, r and t, makes h+r approximately equal to t, that is, h+r\u2248t, and then defines the sum of entity vectors, relationship vectors in the triplet (h, r, t) The correlation between distance vectors; used to measure the distance between h and t. In practical applications, L1 or L2 norm can be used, and the distance formula is as follows:\n\n\nStep 10: During the training process of the model, it is obtained by replacing h or t; \u03b1 is the interval distance parameter with a value greater than 0, [x]+ represents a positive function, that is, when x>0, [x]+=x; When x\u22640, [x]+=0; gradient update only needs to calculate the distance d(h+r, t) and d(h\u2032+r, t\u2032); after the model training is completed, the vectors of entities and relationships are obtained Representation; the model uses the maximum margin method, and its objective function is as follows:\n\n\n[x] + =max(0,x) (12)\n\nAmong them, S(h, r, t) is a triplet in the knowledge base, and S\u2032(h\u2032, r, t\u2032) is a negative sampling triplet. For the parameters of the head element in a certain correct relationship group For h i :\n\n\nAdd constraints under the objective function:\n\n||h||\u22641, ||r||\u22641, ||t||\u22641 (14)\n\nStage 3: Joint representation learning\n\nStep 11: Add the objective functions of TransE to construct a model objective function based on BERT and TransE:\n\nL total =L 1 +\u03b3L 2 (15)\n\nAmong them, \u03b3 is a parameter that balances the contribution ratio of the two models.\n\nCompared with the prior art, the present invention has the following beneficial effects:\n\nThe present invention uses the pre-trained BERT language model to embed the word, obtains a more contextualized representation of the word, and solves the problem that the word embedding representation in the previous method is not rich enough to solve the problem of polysemy; at the same time, the masking of the BERT structure is used The language modeling task uses its triples as sequence input; secondly, for the problem of multiple semantics of the same entity, compared with the previous approach, the present invention usually adopts a dimensional transformation of the TransE model, using projection or transformation matrix to make Mapping entity relationships can have different representations in different fields, but the modified BERT in the present invention can input triples or their description information as text and train them together, while BERT's own mechanism will map entity relationships in different sentences. There will be different word vectors, which effectively solves the problem of different semantics of entity relationships. Therefore, the choice of TransE will not be limited by its model itself. Instead, its model is simple enough to truly reflect the correspondence between triples. At the same time, the complexity of the model is reduced; finally, the present invention uses a joint learning method to fully combine the information of the triplet's own structure with the description information, thereby improving the vectorized representation effect of the triplet entity relationship.\n\n[Picture description]\n\nFigure 1 is an architecture diagram of the present invention;\n\nFigure 2 shows the BERT input format used in the present invention;\n\nFigure 3 shows the BERT descriptive statement used in the present invention as the triplet head entity;\n\nFigure 4 is an example of a triplet used in the present invention;\n\nFigure 5 is an example of negative sample triples in the present invention.\n\n\u3010Detailed ways\u3011\n\nIn order to enable those skilled in the art to better understand the solutions of the present invention, the technical solutions in the embodiments of the present invention will be clearly and completely described below in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present invention.

The format of the triples input by the present invention is shown in Figure 4. In order to simulate the triples The rationality of tuples, the serialized sentence can be two entities or multiple triples packaged together, and BERT is used to complete word vector training. In addition, BERT\u2019s own Special Tokens mechanism can be used to input the descriptive information of triples. This first solves the problem that the traditional pre-training language model method cannot distinguish the polysemous features of words, and also alleviates the noise problem in traditional representation learning due to the insufficient structural information of the triplet itself and the introduction of external information, that is, multi-source information fusion representation learning. . An example of its descriptive information format is shown in Figure 3.\n\nTransE triple input module: train triples through the training mechanism of TransE. The role of this model is to learn the structural information in triples, and use the distance formula to calculate the similarity between triples to learn the dependencies between entity relationships, thereby generating a more accurate word vector representation of triples.\n\nJoint representation learning module: When the input and output of the evaluation functions of the two models are the same, combine the BERT triple input module and the TransE triple input module, combine the two for joint training, and finally obtain the triple word vector represents the best optimization.",
