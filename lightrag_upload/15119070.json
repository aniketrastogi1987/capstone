  "abstract": "Even in circumstances where the size of training data is more than the memory size of a calculator, CD method can be used. A data management apparatus (101) according to the present invention includes a blocking unit (20) which divides training data representing matrix data into a plurality of blocks, and generates meta data indicating a column for which each block holds a value of the original training data, and a re-blocking unit (40) which, when a component of a parameter learned from the training data converges to zero, replaces an old block including an unnecessary column, among the plurality of blocks, with a block from which the unnecessary column has been removed, and regenerates the meta data.",
