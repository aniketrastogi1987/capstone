  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the present invention provide an approach for performing auto-classification of documents. According to some embodiments, a machine learning framework is provided to analyze the document, where labels associated with certain documents can be propagated to other documents. The inventive approach therefore does not rely upon and/or does not use a large (or any) existing body of training materials, but still allows for improvements in analysis results using user feedback. Other additional objects, features, and advantages of the invention are described in the detailed description, figures, and claims.",
