  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An electronic device may include an inner case housing electronic components and so on, and an outer case housing the inner case. A microphone may be housed in the inner case. The present disclosure provides a structure guiding sound to a microphone in an electronic device including the inner case housing the microphone and so on, and the outer case housing the inner case. An electronic device according to the present disclosure has a microphone. The electronic device comprises a display member, an inner case disposed on a non-display face side of the display member and housing the microphone, and an outer case surrounding a side portion of the display member and housing the inner case. A gap is provided between the side portion of the display member and the outer case, the inner case has an opening formed in the vicinity of the gap, the microphone is disposed in the vicinity of the opening in a space within the inner case. According to the present disclosure, a sound generated outside the electronic device can be transmitted to the microphone through the gap between the side portion of the display member and the outer case and through the opening disposed in the inner case in the vicinity of the gap. In this case, since the opening of the inner case is disposed in the vicinity of the gap between the side portion of the display member and the outer case, the sound entering through the gap can efficiently be transmitted to the microphone.",
