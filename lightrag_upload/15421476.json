  "abstract": "Partial reconfigurable regions each perform a process by using, from among a plurality of functional modules, a functional module arranged in each of the partial reconfigurable regions, respectively. An arrangement decision unit decides, on the basis of the maximum operation frequency for each of the partial reconfigurable regions in a case where each of the functional modules is arranged in each of the partial reconfigurable regions, the arrangement of the functional module into each of the partial reconfigurable regions. An arrangement processing unit arranges the functional modules in the partial reconfigurable regions on the basis of the arrangement decided by the arrangement decision unit.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to an aspect of an embodiment, an information processing apparatus includes: a plurality of partial reconfigurable regions that performs processes by using, from among a plurality of functional modules, the functional module that is arranged in each of the partial reconfigurable regions, respectively; an arrangement decision unit that decides the arrangement of the functional module into each of the partial reconfigurable regions on the basis of the maximum operation frequency for each of the partial reconfigurable regions in a case where each of the functional modules is arranged in the partial reconfigurable regions; and an arrangement processing unit that arranges the functional modules in the partial reconfigurable regions on the basis of the arrangement decided by the arrangement decision unit. The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.",
