  "abstract": "There are provided systems and methods for predicting an image/label relevant to text input by a user. In a first aspect, there is provided a system comprising a means for receiving text input by a user and a prediction means trained on sections of text associated with an image/label. The prediction means is configured to receive the text input by the user, determine the relevance of the text input by the user to the sections of text associated with the image/label, and predict on image/label the basis of the sections of text associated with the language model 10 image/label the relevance of the image/label to the text input by the user. The systems and methods of the present invention reduce the burden of entering an image/label.",
