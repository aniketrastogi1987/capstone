  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An illustrative method includes receiving data from a sensor over time. The data comprises a plurality of values that are each indicative of a sensed condition at a unique time. The method also includes determining a real-time value, a mid-term moving average, and a long-term moving average based on the data and determining a most-recent combined average by averaging the real-time value, the mid-term moving average, and the long-term moving average. The method further includes determining an upper setpoint by adding an offset value to the most-recent combined average and determining a lower setpoint by subtracting the offset value to the most-recent combined average. The method also includes transmitting an alert based on a determination that a most recent value of the data is either greater than the upper setpoint or lower than the lower setpoint. An illustrative device includes a memory configured to store data received from a sensor over time and a processor. The data comprises a plurality of values that are each indicative of a sensed condition at a unique time. The processor is operatively coupled to the memory. The device is configured to determine a real-time value, a mid-term moving average, and a long-term moving average based on the data and determine a most-recent combined average by averaging the real-time value, the mid-term moving average, and the long-term moving average. The processor is further configured to determine an upper setpoint by adding an offset value to the most-recent combined average and determine a lower setpoint by subtracting the offset value to the most-recent combined average. The method is also configured to transmit an alert based on a determination that a most recent value of the data is either greater than the upper setpoint or lower than the lower setpoint. An illustrative non-transitory computer-readable medium has computer-readable instructions stored thereon that, upon execution by a processor, cause a de...",
