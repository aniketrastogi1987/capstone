A stale question is a question where an answer to the stale question is not detected as being posted to the online discussion site. The identified stale question is analyzed to determine a trigger post, with the trigger post being designed to instigate an answer to the question that is to be posted to the online discussion site by a community member. The trigger post is automatically generating and posted to the online discussion site. The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent in the non-limiting detailed description set forth below.",
