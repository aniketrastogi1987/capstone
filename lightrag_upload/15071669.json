  "abstract": "According to an embodiment, a detection apparatus detects a partial series similar to a search pattern from a parameter series including a sequence of parameters. The apparatus includes a local score acquirer, a difference score calculator, an accumulative score calculator, and a determiner. The local score acquirer is configured to acquire a local score representing a likelihood of the parameter in the search pattern for each of the parameters. The difference score calculator is configured to calculate a difference score by subtracting a threshold from the local score for each of the parameters. The accumulative score calculator is configured to calculate an accumulative score by accumulating the difference scores. The determiner is configured to compare the accumulative score with a reference value in size to determine whether the partial series is similar to the search pattern.",
