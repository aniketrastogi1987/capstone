  "abstract": "A semiconductor device includes a semiconductor substrate having an upper first main face and first and second recess areas formed in the upper first main face, a battery arranged at the first recess area and one or more of a shock sensor and an acceleration sensor arranged at the second recess area. The shock sensor or the acceleration sensor includes a movable mass, a cantilever connected to the moveable mass, a piezoelectric layer applied to the cantilever, and a wiring connected to the piezoelectric layer. The wiring has first and second terminals. The moveable mass and part of the cantilever are arranged above the second recess area, so that the shock sensor or the acceleration sensor delivers a voltage between the first and second terminals, a strength of the voltage being dependent on a strength of a shock or acceleration exerted on the semiconductor device.",
