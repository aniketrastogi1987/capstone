  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The embodiments of present application provide a data query method and apparatus, in order to resolve a technical problem in the prior art that a cross-database join processing manner is excessively monotonous, and is not flexible enough. A first aspect of the embodiments of present application provides a data query method. The method includes receiving a query request, where the query request includes a query condition, the query condition relates to N different databases, and N is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The method also includes calculating a query cost of each cross-database join processing manner of M cross-database join processing manners, where the query cost of each cross-database join processing manner is a cost for performing, by using each cross-database join processing manner, in the N different databases, data query corresponding to the query condition, and M is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The method also includes determining a cross-database join processing manner for current use according to the query cost of each cross-database join processing manner, where the cross-database join processing manner for current use is one of the M cross-database join processing manners; and performing, by using the cross-database join processing manner for current use, in the N different databases, data query corresponding to the query condition. With reference to the first aspect, in a first possible implementation manner of the first aspect, the calculating a query cost of each cross-database join processing manner of M cross-database join processing manners specifically includes: acquiring statistical information corresponding to the query condition, of the N different databases; and calculating the query cost of each cross-database join processing manner according to the statistical information and a cost parameter of an atomic operation item included in the cross-database join processing manner. With reference to the fi...",
