  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present disclosure describes methods and systems for managing the write performance of an non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM)-based storage subsystem. In one aspect, some implementations include a method of managing a hosted non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) based storage subsystem that includes NVRAM devices. The method includes: receiving, at a device driver on the host computing device, write requests each requesting to write a respective unit of data to the NVRAM-based storage subsystem; categorizing the write requests into subgroups of write requests, where write requests within respective subgroups are mutually exclusive; ascertaining a load condition of each of several of the NVRAM devices of the NVRAM-based storage subsystem; identifying a target location on at least one NVRAM device to service a particular subgroup of write requests according to the ascertained load conditions of the NVRAM devices of the NVRAM-based storage subsystem; and servicing the particular subgroup of write requests by writing the corresponding units of data to the identified target location on the at least one NVRAM device of the NVRAM-based storage subsystem. Implementations may include one or more of the following features. Servicing the particular subgroup of write requests may include writing the respective unit of data of a first write request categorized in one of the subgroup of write requests at a first target location and writing the respective unit of data of a second write request categorized in one other of the subgroup of write requests at a second target location, where the first and second target locations are separated by a distance of memory locations within which data is otherwise stored prior to writing the respective units of data of the first and second write requests. Servicing the particular subgroup of write requests may further include projecting the corresponding unit of data of the write requests categorized within a fi...",
