  "abstract": "An example system includes a memory store of aggregate definitions. Each aggregate definition specifies a key value, an output store, a feature, a half-life value, and an aggregate operation metric to apply to a cross of the feature and the half-life value to generate aggregate metrics. The system also includes an aggregation engine that generates aggregate feature records from the input source based on the aggregate definitions and stores the aggregate feature records in the output store. An aggregate feature record includes an aggregate of the metric for the feature decayed over time using the half-life. The system also includes a query service that identifies, using the aggregate definitions, responsive aggregate feature records that satisfy parameters of a received request, applies the half-life to the responsive feature records, and provides the responsive feature records to a requester, the requester using the responsive feature records as input for a neural network.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Implementations provide a flexible infrastructure for defining, calculating, and using historical data to generate input features for a machine learned model. The features generated by the historical data can be used to improve the predictions of the model for particular data items (e.g., for personalized recommendations). Aggregate features are data records that store a value for an aggregate function (count, average, etc.) of a feature over some window of time. These values may be referred to herein as metrics or aggregate metrics. The infrastructure includes an aggregate definition schema and a common output data record format that enables new aggregates (groupings) and new metrics for the aggregates to be added on-the-fly. The aggregate feature records can be indexed by one or more fields. The schema enables a user to define what fields to index, what fields to perform the aggregate operations on, and how long of a half-life to apply to the decay. The schema can operate on any input records. The schema can be used by offline/batch processes, as well as online/real-time processes. Thus, implementations can capture signals that are important for a short time frame. Such aggregates can be used to provide more relevant content for a particular user with low latency, e.g., to find real-time information and to provide query suggestions (e.g., type-ahead, spelling, related searches) that are also fresh and real-time. In one aspect, a system includes at least one processor and memory storing aggregate definitions. Each aggregate definition may specify a key, an output store, a feature, a half-life value, and an aggregate operation to apply to a cross of the feature and the half-life value to generate aggregate metrics. The system may also include memory storing an aggregation engine configured to generate aggregate feature records from the input source based on the aggregate definitions and store the aggregate feature records in the output store, an a...",
