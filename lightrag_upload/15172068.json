  "abstract": "Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage media, for augmenting neural networks with an external memory. One of the methods includes providing an output derived from the neural network output for the time step as a system output for the time step; maintaining a current state of the external memory; determining, from the neural network output for the time step, memory state parameters for the time step; updating the current state of the external memory using the memory state parameters for the time step; reading data from the external memory in accordance with the updated state of the external memory; and combining the data read from the external memory with a system input for the next time step to generate the neural network input for the next time step.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This specification describes technologies that relate to augmenting neural networks with an external memory. For a system of one or more computers to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the system has installed on it software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them that in operation cause the system to perform the operations or actions. For one or more computer programs to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the one or more programs include instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operations or actions. The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular embodiments so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Augmenting recurrent neural networks with an external memory as described in this specification allows the networks to implement continuously differentiable analogues of traditional data structures, e.g., Stacks, Queues, and Double-Ended Queues. Augmenting recurrent neural networks with an external memory as described in this specification provides a logically unbounded memory while permitting efficient constant time push and pop operations. Such augmented recurrent neural networks exhibit superior generalization performance on sequence transduction tasks as compared to non-augmented recurrent neural networks. Additionally, such augmented recurrent neural networks are able to learn to reproduce the generating transduction algorithms and generalize to inputs well beyond those encountered in training. The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.",
