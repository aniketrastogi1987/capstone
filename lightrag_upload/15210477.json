  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to a first aspect of the present invention, provided is an apparatus comprising a processor and one or more computer readable mediums collectively including instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: acquire a candidate for a solution of an optimization problem for optimizing a third objective function based on a first objective function and a second objective function; obtain, as another candidate for the solution of the optimization problem, a solution that optimizes the second objective function under a constraint corresponding to a value of the first objective function for the acquired candidate; and select the solution of the optimization problem from among the plurality of candidates for the solution of the optimization problem. Also provided as the first aspect are a method and non-transitory computer readable storage medium. The first aspect may be operable to calculate solution candidates of the third objective function based on the first objective function and the second objective function, and select a preferable solution of the third objective function from among the plurality of solution candidates. According to a second aspect of the present invention, provided are an apparatus and method in which the second objective function has an objective function value based on a sum of objective function values for partial problems of the optimization problem. The second aspect may be operable to calculate the solution of the optimization problem for optimizing the third objective function, based on the first objective function and on the second objective function for which the optimal solution can be written as the sum of optimal solutions of the partial problems. According to a third aspect of the present invention, provided are an apparatus and method in which the first objective function has an objective function value based on a largest value or a smallest value of the objective function values fo...",
