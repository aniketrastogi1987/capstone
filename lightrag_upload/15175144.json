  "abstract": "Disclosed herein is a computing device configured to implement power aware packet distribution. The computing device includes a central processing unit (CPU) comprising a plurality of cores and an interface controller communicatively coupled to the CPU. The interface controller is configured to receive a data packet to be sent to a targeted core of the plurality of cores and identify a power state of the targeted core. The interface controller is configured to redirect the data packet to an alternate core based on the power state of the targeted core.",
