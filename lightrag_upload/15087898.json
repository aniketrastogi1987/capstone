According to another embodiment, a computer-implemented method for multiplexing a neural core circuit comprises, for an integer multiplexing factor T that is greater than zero, configuring T sets of electronic neurons, configuring T sets of electronic axons, where each set of the T sets of electronic axons corresponds to one of the T sets of electronic neurons, and configuring an synaptic interconnection network comprising a plurality of electronic synapses that each interconnect a single electronic axon to a single electronic neuron, where the interconnection network interconnects each set of the T sets of electronic axons to its corresponding set of electronic neurons. According to yet another embodiment, a neurosynaptic system comprises a neurosynaptic chip, a single-core neurosynaptic module as a component on a chip, or a multi-core neurosynaptic module as a component on a chip, including a plurality of multiplexed neural core circuits interconnected via an on-chip network, where each of the plurality of multiplexed neural core circuits comprises, for an integer multiplexing factor T that is greater than zero, T sets of electronic neurons, T sets of electronic axons, where each set of the T sets of electronic axons corresponds to one of the T sets of electronic neurons, and a synaptic interconnection network comprising a plurality of electronic synapse...",
