  "abstract": "Live-action event data is received during a live-action event from an event reporting computing system via a computer network interface. The live-action event data is provided to a machine-learning prediction machine previously trained with previously-completed event data to output a prediction for an upcoming aspect of the live-action event. The prediction is sent to a client computing system via the computer network interface prior to commencement of the upcoming aspect to enhance a live-action event experience provided by the client computing system.",
