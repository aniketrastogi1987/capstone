  "abstract": "The invention discloses a method, a device and a system to build and/or use models for estimating behaviours of, or situations of interest to users. Said users have a device which is configured to capture at least a first dataset of sensor data in relation to the behaviour or situation. A set of processing capabilities is configured to capture first datasets comprising sensor data and second datasets comprising annotated data in relation to the behaviour or situation and to further configure at least a model. The device is further configured to adjust parameters of the at least a model to the characteristics of the user or of a group of users. The invention allows for an improvement over the prior art by allowing collection of a vast amount of data that will optimize the fit of the models to the behaviour or situation.",
