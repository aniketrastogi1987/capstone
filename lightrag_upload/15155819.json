  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The invention is defined by the features of the independent claims. Some specific embodiments are defined in the dependent claims. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising at least one processing core, at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code being configured to, with the at least one processing core, cause the apparatus at least to obtain, using a first image recognition or depth sensing mechanism, first information defining an input space, obtain, using the first or a second image recognition or depth sensing mechanism, second information defining a virtual output area, and cause rendering of sensor information captured from the input space into the virtual output area. Various embodiments of the first aspect may comprise at least one feature from the following bulleted list: the at least one memory and the computer program code are configured to, with the at least one processing core, cause the apparatus to cause the sensor information to be rendered in the virtual output area via a head mounted display, to enable a user to experience the virtual output area as a virtual screen hovering in air the head mounted display comprises at least one of an eyeglass display and a projector configured to project optically encoded information directly to an eye the apparatus is configured to provide, based at least in part on the first information, control inputs to a sensor device to cause the sensor device to capture the sensor information from the input space the first image recognition or depth sensing mechanism comprises a software mechanism configured to determine the first information based on at least one optical sensor and a depth sensing capability the second image recognition or depth sensing mechanism comprises a software mechanism configured to determine the second information based on at least one optical se...",
