  "abstract": "[Object] A data analysis system designed to be capable of checking the growth process of artificial intelligence is provided. [Solution] The data analysis system includes artificial intelligence implemented by execution of a control program by a controller wherein the artificial intelligence evaluates data and classifies the data on the basis of an evaluation result, while growing through a learning step; the artificial intelligence evaluates a plurality of pieces of evaluation data; and the controller finds distribution of the evaluation of the plurality of pieces of evaluation data at a plurality of time points, further creates report information based on the distribution, and outputs the report information.",
