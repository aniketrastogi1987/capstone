  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In at least some embodiments, a system for gesture-controlled piling of displayed data includes a memory configured to store a plurality of data items; a display including a touch sensitive portion configured to display the plurality of data items; a processing component operatively coupled to the memory and to the display, the processing component configured to: control the display to display the plurality of data items; receive at least one first selection signal from the touch-sensitive portion of the display indicating a selection of a first data item of the plurality of displayed data items; receive at least one second selection signal from the touch-sensitive portion of the display indicating a selection of one or more second data items of the plurality of displayed data items; and control the display to alter the display of the plurality of data items such that the one or more second data items are no longer displayed and to alter the display of the first data item to visually indicate that the one or more second data items are piled into a pile with the first data item. Similarly, in at least some implementations, a system for gesture-controlled piling of displayed data, comprises a display operable to detect at least one of a gesture proximate at least a gesture-sensitive portion of the display or a touch of a touch-sensitive portion of the display, the display configured to display a plurality of data items; a processing component operatively coupled to the display, the processing component configured to: control the display to display a plurality of data items; detect using at least one of the gesture-sensitive portion or the touch-sensitive portion a selection of a first data item of the plurality of displayed data items; detect using at least one of the gesture-sensitive portion or the touch-sensitive portion a selection of one or more second data items of the plurality of displayed data items; and control the display to alter the dis...",
