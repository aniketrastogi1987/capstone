  "abstract": "Systems, products, and methods are disclosed for improving the accuracy of predictions. Possible values of an output variable can be generated based on past values and possible values of input variables and a model. Multiple scenarios can be run, each of which may vary in many factors, such as the model used and the input variables used. Results from multiple scenarios can be presented to a user. Prediction accuracy can be improved through selection of one or more desirable scenarios.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Certain aspects and features of the present disclosure relate to a system, comprising one or more data processors; and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium containing instructions which, when executed on the one or more data processors, cause the one or more data processors to perform operations including: storing a plurality of models, each model being associated with an input variable and an output variable and each model operable to estimate possible values for the output variable associated with that model; storing scenario information, wherein storing scenario information includes associating each of a plurality of scenarios with two or more of the plurality of models; displaying scenario selection information on a graphical interface by individually depicting each of the plurality of scenarios, wherein individually depicting a scenario includes depicting the models that are associated with that scenario, and wherein depicting a model includes indicating the input variable and the output variable associated with that model; receiving a scenario selection input indicating a selected one of the plurality of scenarios; receiving a model selection input indicating a selected one of the plurality of models associated with the selected scenario; receiving input variable information; generating possible values of the input variable associated with the selected model using the input variable information; and generating a collection of values of the output variable associated with the selected model using the selected model and the possible input values. Certain aspects and features of the present disclosure relate to a computer-implemented method comprising: storing a plurality of models, each model being associated with an input variable and an output variable and each model operable to estimate possible values for the output variable associated with that model; storing scenario information, wherein storing scenario information includes...",
