  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>It is to be understood that both the following general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive. Provided are methods and systems for methods and systems for analyzing travel data and determining associated user recommendations. Systems and methods are described for receiving travel data associated with a user, generating a predictive model, receiving additional travel data associated with the user, and generating, based on applying the predictive model to the additional travel data, one or more recommendations. Additional advantages will be set forth in part in the description which follows or may be learned by practice. The advantages will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.",
