  "abstract": "Embodiments of apparatus and methods for capturing and generating user experiences are described. In embodiments, an apparatus may include a processor. The apparatus may also include a data storage module, coupled with the processor, to store sensor data collected by a plurality of sensors attached to one or more devices. The apparatus may further include an experience correlation module, coupled with the data storage module, to associate at least a portion of the sensor data with a user experience based at least in part on one or more rules identifying the user experience, to enable regenerating at least a part of the user experience for a user based at least in part on the portion of the sensor data. Other embodiments may be described and/or claimed.",
