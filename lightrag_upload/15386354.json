  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The following is a non-exhaustive listing of some aspects of the present techniques. These and other aspects are described in the following disclosure. Some aspects include a process of configuring a dashboard of a graphical user interface, the process including: obtaining, with one or more processors, a plurality of identifiers of a respective plurality of metrics of data, the metrics being different respective measurements based on the data, the data having values to be visualized in a plurality of graphs that graphically represent the metrics of the data in a dashboard; obtaining, with one or more processors, respective features of the metrics, the features being properties of the metrics, at least some features being properties of the respective metrics that are independent of values of the respective metrics; accessing, with one or more processors, in a graph-effectiveness matrix, for each of a plurality of candidate graphs, respective effectiveness scores corresponding to the obtained features of the metrics (the graph-effectiveness matrix comprising: a first dimension corresponding to a set of candidate graphs to graphically represent metrics of the data, a second dimension corresponding to a set of features of metrics, the set of features being a superset of at least some of the obtained features of the metrics, and effectiveness scores as values of the graph-effectiveness matrix corresponding to an inferred effectiveness of the respective candidate graph at representing metrics having the respective feature of metrics, wherein effectiveness scores are determined by training a machine-learning model with a training set correlating indicia of effectiveness to previous graphs of metrics with features among the feature dimension set of features); selecting, with one or more processors, a plurality of graphs to graphically represent the metrics of the data in a dashboard from among the candidate graphs based on the accessed effectiveness score...",
