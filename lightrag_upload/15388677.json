  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments are directed to a method of reading data from a synapse of a neuromorphic device. Embodiments are directed to a method of reading data from a synapse in a sub-threshold voltage region. Embodiments are directed to a method of implementing an excitatory synapse and an inhibitory synapse in a reading mode. In an embodiment, there is provided a method of reading data from a synapse which includes a transistor and a variable resistor. The transistor may have a gate electrode, a first electrode and a second electrode. The variable resistor may have a first electrode connected to the second electrode of the transistor. The method may include: applying a read voltage to the gate electrode of the transistor; applying a pre-synaptic voltage to the first electrode of the transistor; and applying a post-synaptic voltage to a second electrode of the variable resistor. The read voltage may be lower than the threshold voltage of the transistor. The post-synaptic voltage may be substantially zero. An absolute value of a difference between the read voltage and the post-synaptic voltage may be smaller than the threshold voltage. The pre-synaptic voltage may be a positive (+) voltage. The read voltage may be a positive voltage. The pre-synaptic voltage may be greater than the read voltage. An absolute value of a difference between the read voltage and the pre-synaptic voltage may be smaller than the threshold voltage. The pre-synaptic voltage may be a negative (âˆ’) voltage. The read voltage may be a negative voltage. The pre-synaptic voltage may be lower than the read voltage. In an embodiment, there is provided a method of reading data from a synapse which includes a transistor and a variable resistor. The transistor may have a gate electrode, a first electrode and a second electrode. The variable resistor may have a first electrode connected to the second electrode of the transistor.
