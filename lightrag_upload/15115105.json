  "abstract": "A causal relationship is represented with a data structure including target identification information for identifying a target, index identification information of each of indexes to be used for quantitatively describing an event that occurs to the target, and causal relationship information for each pair of two indexes selected from the indexes. The causal relationship information includes direction information representing which one of the two indexes is a cause index and which one is an effect index, strength information representing a causal strength between the cause index and the effect index, time information representing a delay time for propagation of an influence of the cause index to the effect index, and correlation information representing a direction of change in the effect index with respect to an increase or decrease in the cause index.",
