  "abstract": "Aspects relate to a computer implemented method for detecting abnormal contention. The computer implemented method includes collecting resource modeling data for a serially reusable resource, wherein the resource modeling data includes one or more of request count data and contention data and storing, in a computer readable storage medium, the resource modeling data in an in-memory database. The method also includes creating and training a first model and a second model using the resource modeling data and one or more cognitive computing tasks and categorizing a contention event as an abnormal contention event using the first model and the second model.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In accordance with an embodiment, a method for detecting abnormal contention is provided. The method includes collecting, using a processor, resource modeling data for a serially reusable resource, wherein the resource modeling data includes one or more of request count data and contention data and storing, in a computer readable storage medium, the resource modeling data in an in-memory database. The method also includes creating and training, using the processor, a first model and a second model, using the resource modeling data and one or more cognitive computing tasks and categorizing, using the processor, a contention event as an abnormal contention event using the first model and the second model. In accordance with another embodiment, a system for detecting abnormal contention is provided. The system includes a memory having computer readable instructions and one or more processors for executing the computer readable instructions. The computer readable instructions include collecting resource modeling data for a serially reusable resource, wherein the resource modeling data includes one or more of request count data and contention data and storing, in the memory, the resource modeling data in an in-memory database. The computer readable instructions also include creating and training a first model and a second model using the resource modeling data and one or more cognitive computing tasks and categorizing a contention event as an abnormal contention event using the first model and the second model. In accordance with a further embodiment, a computer program product for detecting abnormal contention includes a non-transitory storage medium readable by a processing circuit and storing instructions for execution by the processing circuit for performing a method. The program instructions executable by a processor to cause the processor to collect resource modeling data for a serially reusable resource, wherein the resource modeling data includ...",
