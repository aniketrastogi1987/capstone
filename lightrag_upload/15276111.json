  "abstract": "An integrated circuit (IC), as a computation block of a neuromorphic system, includes a time step controller to activate a time step update signal for performing a time-multiplexed selection of a group of neuromorphic states to update. The IC includes a first circuitry to, responsive to detecting the time step update signal for a selected group of neuromorphic states: generate an outgoing data signal in response to determining that a first membrane potential of the selected group of neuromorphic states exceeds a threshold value, wherein the outgoing data signal includes an identifier that identifies the selected group of neuromorphic states and a memory address (wherein the memory address corresponds to a location in a memory block associated with the integrated circuit), and update a state of the selected group of neuromorphic states in response to generation of the outgoing data signal.",
