  "abstract": "Methods and systems to reduce the number of factors or variables that need to be considered in generating a function such as a prediction function. The methods and systems may involve receiving a first set of factors and a data set associated with the first set of factors, calculating an importance value of each factor in the first set of factors, and selecting, based on the importance values, a second set of factors. In some embodiments, the methods and systems also include generating the prediction function based on the data set and the second set of factors.",
