  "abstract": "A method is described for analyzing images of the face of a human being. The method can include the following steps: —acquiring at least one image of the face such that the nose, the eyes and the cheeks are aligned on pre-existing markers, —determining the components of the image in at least one zone of the face, —comparing the components to stored values, and —determining the presence of a flush effect if the components are greater than the stored values.",
