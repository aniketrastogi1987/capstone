  "abstract": "Proposed is a bracelet-type transmission/reception device comprising: a cartilage conduction vibration source provided in a portion to be attached to a wrist; a speaker; a variable directional microphone; and a control unit which sets the directivity of the variable directional microphone to the back side of a hand when the speaker is used and sets the directivity of the variable directional microphone to the palm side of the hand when the cartilage conduction vibration source is used. The bracelet-type transmission/reception device is provided together with a display means for information relating to a transmission/reception method or a handling explanation medium or advertising medium having the information relating to the transmission/reception method. An example of a method for use thereof is to conduct the vibration of the cartilage conduction vibration source to a thumb and to bring the thumb into contact with a tragus in a state where the back of the hand faces forward.
