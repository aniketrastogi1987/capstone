  "abstract": "An information processing system includes: a setting unit to set a normal range showing a range of normal values of monitoring target data of time series signals by defining an upper limit and a lower limit; a determination unit to determine whether the monitoring target data is out of the normal range or not and to feed the determined time which is output in case of deviation and which is judged to be the time for the monitoring target data to turn to be out of the normal range; and a detection unit to determine the start time that is before the determined time entering from the determination unit and which is the time for the monitoring target data to start to show an anomaly on the basis of the degree of deviation showing a deviation of the monitoring target data from a mean of multiple learning data which consist of normal value signals from among already-acquired monitoring target data. This enables the system to more accurately determine the time for the signal to start to show a...",
