  "abstract": "A learning method for a multilayer neural network, implemented by a computer, includes starting first learning with an initial value of a learning rate, and maintaining the learning rate at the initial value or reducing the learning rate from the initial value as the first learning progresses. The learning rate is increased after the first learning. Second learning is started with the increased learning rate, and the increased learning rate is reduced as the second learning progresses.",
