  "abstract": "The subject of the invention is a method and an apparatus for efficient data processing, using principles of Quantum Mechanics. A method of evolving a quantum register from an initial state ψ to a desired final state ψyes of said register characterized by comprising of backtracking to the state computationally equivalent to initial state ψ by mapping each and every unknown, undesirable final state ψnot of the quantum register to the superposition or ensemble of orthogonal states in the computations space, when the projection measurement of a quantum register or parts of said register rendered it in the undesirable state ψnot.",
