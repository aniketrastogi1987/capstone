  "abstract": "Disclosed is a method of predicting a sugar content and acidity of fruits that is capable of predicting a sugar content and acidity of ripe fruits before harvest using samples of unripe fruits. The predicted sugar content and acidity can be used as data for quality management of fruits, such as output control of fruits, before the fruits become fully ripe. In addition, the predicted sugar content and acidity can be used as data for selection of candidate seeds, so that efficiency of development of new varieties can be improved.",
