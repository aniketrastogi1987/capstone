  "abstract": "Examples of the present disclosure describe systems and methods of overlaying a plurality of isolated collections to generate an overlaid isolated collection. In an example, a first and second isolated collection having at least one common resource may be overlaid. A first and second inference ruleset may be extracted from the first and second isolated collection, respectively. Based on the first and second inference ruleset, one or more suggestions may be generated relating to conflicting inference rules. A suggestion may comprise selecting a subset of the conflicting inference rules (e.g., none, some, or all of the rules) for inclusion in the overlay isolated collection. Another suggestion may comprise generating a new inference rule based on the conflicting inference rules. An indication relating to the suggestions may be received. The indication may be used to generate a third isolated collection and a third inference ruleset.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detail Description section. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Examples of the present disclosure describe systems and methods of overlaying a plurality of isolated collections to generate an overlaid isolated collection. In an example, a first and second isolated collection may be overlaid, wherein the first and second isolated collection contain at least one common resource. A first and second inference ruleset may be extracted from the first and second isolated collection, respectively. Based on the first and second inference ruleset, one or more suggestions may be generated relating to conflicting inference rules contained within the first and second ruleset. A suggestion may comprise selecting a subset of the conflicting inference rules (e.g., none, some, or all of the rules) or generating a new inference rule based on the conflicting inference rules, among others. A selection may be received relating to the generated suggestions. Based on the selection, a third isolated collection may be generated, wherein the third isolated collection is comprised of resources and/or relationships from the first and second isolated collection. In some examples, a subset may be used, wherein the subset is comprised of resources and relationships that are directly or indirectly related to the at least one common resource. The third isolated collection may be associated with a third inference ruleset, which may also be generated based on the selection. As a result, the third inference ruleset may comprise a subset of inference rules from the first and second inference ruleset. This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further...",
