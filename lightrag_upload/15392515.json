  "abstract": "In a datacenter setting, root causes of anomalies corresponding to components in the datacenter are predicted. Initially, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to consider the evolution sequence of the datacenter infrastructure. Given a set of training data (sequences of datacenter states that are labeled with root causes of the anomalies present in the sequences), the CNN learns which sequences of datacenter states correspond to the labels of root causes. Accordingly, given a set of input or test data (sequences of datacenter states that are not labeled with root causes of the anomalies present in the sequences), the CNN is able to predict a root cause for the anomaly even in a previously unseen or different datacenter infrastructure.",

This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor should it be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to predicting root causes of anomalies in a datacenter. To do so, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to consider the evolution sequence of the datacenter infrastructure. Given a set of training data (sequences of datacenter states that are labeled with root causes of the anomalies present in the sequences), the CNN learns which sequences of datacenter states correspond to the labels of root causes.
