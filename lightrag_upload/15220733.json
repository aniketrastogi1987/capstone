  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Various embodiments of the present disclosure can include systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media configured to receive a plurality of comments to a posted content item. Each of the plurality of comments is associated with at least one category of a plurality of categories based on a machine learning model. A first comment of the plurality of comments is selected for inclusion in a comment sample to be presented in a graphical user interface based on the first comment being associated with a first category of the plurality of categories. A second comment of the plurality of comments is selected for inclusion in the comment sample based on the second comment being associated with a second category of the plurality of categories. In an embodiment, the associating each of the plurality of comments with at least one category of the plurality of categories based on the machine learning model comprises determining, based on the machine learning model, whether a comment satisfies a relevance score threshold indicative of relevance to the posted content item. In an embodiment, the associating each of the plurality of comments with at least one category of the plurality of categories based on the machine learning model comprises determining, based on the machine learning model, whether a comment satisfies an agreement score threshold indicative of agreement with the posted content item. In an embodiment, the associating each of the plurality of comments with at least one category of the plurality of categories based on the machine learning model comprises determining, based on the machine learning model, whether a comment satisfies a neutrality score threshold indicative of neutrality with regard to the posted content item. In an embodiment, the associating each of the plurality of comments with at least one category of the plurality of categories based on the machine learning model comprises, for each comment: determining, based on th...",
