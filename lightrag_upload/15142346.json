  "abstract": "Disclosed is a guidance technique that can be applied to guide search and analysis of stored data by a user. The technique can include inputting from a user a portion of a search query expressed in a pipelined search language, at a system for indexing and searching machine data. The system generates and outputs search guidance for the user as the user builds the search query, by applying the portion of the query to an operation flow model, where the operation flow model represents a plurality of searches performable by the system. The operation flow model has been generated based on multi-user historical search data and includes a plurality of states, each representing a different group of related commands of the pipelined search language.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>One or more embodiments of the present disclosure are illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like references indicate similar elements. FIG. 1 illustrates a networked computer environment in which an embodiment may be implemented. FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of an example data intake and query system in which an embodiment may be implemented. FIG. 3 is a flow diagram that illustrates how indexers process, index, and store data received from forwarders in accordance with the disclosed embodiments. FIG. 4 is a flow diagram that illustrates how a search head and indexers perform a search query. FIG. 5 is a flow diagram that illustrates an example process of the preprocessing phase of the guidance technique introduced herein. FIG. 6 is a flow diagram that illustrates an example process of the run time phase of the guidance technique. FIG. 7 is a flow diagram that illustrates a more detailed example process of the run time phase of the guidance technique. FIG. 8A illustrates an example of a search screen of a search graphical user interface (GUI). FIG. 8B illustrates an example of a data summary dialog of the search GUI. FIG. 9A shows an example of a first search screen display including dynamic search guidance for the user. FIG. 9B shows an example of a second search screen display including dynamic search guidance for the user. FIG. 9C shows an example of a third search screen display including dynamic search guidance for the user. FIG. 10 shows an example of an operation flow graph that represents an operation flow model. FIG. 11 is a block diagram showing an example of the functional elements of the search head of the data intake and query system. FIG. 12 shows a high-level example of a hardware architecture of a processing system that can be used to implement any one or more of the functional components described herein. detailed-description descriptio...",
