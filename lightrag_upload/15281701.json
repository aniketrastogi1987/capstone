  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a carrier tape, a method for manufacturing the same, and a method for manufacturing an RFID tag capable of improving the handleability of a component used in a method for connecting an electronic component and a connection object. A method for manufacturing a carrier tape according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a method for manufacturing a carrier tape that houses a plurality of electronic components with seal materials, the method including the steps of preparing a tape-shaped main body including a plurality of housing holes including bottom surfaces along a longitudinal direction; providing chip-shaped electronic components respectively in the plurality of the housing holes; affixing a tape-shaped seal material including an adhesive layer on one principal surface to the tape-shaped main body, such that the adhesive layer covers the housing holes and adheres to the electronic components; and forming cuts in the tape-shaped seal material to separate portions defining and functioning as the seal materials including portions at least partially overlapping with the respective housing holes in a planar view from the other portions. A carrier tape according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a carrier tape that houses a plurality of electronic components with seal materials, including a tape-shaped main body that includes a plurality of housing holes including bottom surfaces along a longitudinal direction; a plurality of chip-shaped electronic components respectively housed in the plurality of the housing holes; and a plurality of seal materials including an adhesive layer on one principal surface and affixed to the tape-shaped main body, such that the adhesive layer covers the housing holes and adheres to the electronic components. A method for manufacturing an RFID tag according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention include...",
