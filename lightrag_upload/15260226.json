  "abstract": "A method of estimating one or more conditional probabilities may be provided. A method may include determining one or more states based on user input, and determining a similarity measurement between at least one state pair of one or more state pairs. The method may further include determining a likelihood of probability for the at least one state pair of the one or more state pairs. Moreover, the method may include estimating a conditional probability for the at least one state pair of the one or more state pairs based on the determined likelihood of probability and the determined one or more states.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>One or more embodiments of the present disclosure may include a method of estimating one or more conditional probabilities. The method may include determining one or more states based on user input, and determining a similarity measurement between at least one state pair of one or more state pairs. The method may further include determining a likelihood of probability for the at least one state pair of the one or more state pairs. Moreover, the method may include estimating a conditional probability for the at least one state pair of the one or more state pairs based on the determined likelihood of probability and the determined one or more states. The object and advantages of the embodiments will be realized and achieved at least by the elements, features, and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims. Both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive.",
