One or more virtual sensor models are automatically identified according to a semantic graph, having a knowledge domain that links and describes a relationship between observed variables associated with one or more sensors with unobserved variables associated with the IoT environment. The one or more virtual sensor models may be selected for deployment in the IoT environment according to one or more combinations of virtual sensor inputs.",

In one embodiment, by way of example only, a method for using virtual sensor models in an internet of things (IoT) environment, again by a processor, is provided. One or more virtual sensor models are automatically identified according to a semantic graph, having a knowledge domain that links and describes a relationship between observed variables associated with one or more sensors and unobserved variables associated with the IoT environment. The one or more virtual sensor models may be selected for deployment in the IoT environment according to one or more combinations of virtual sensor inputs.",
