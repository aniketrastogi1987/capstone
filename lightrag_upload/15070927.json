  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF INVENTION <EOH>The present invention is directed to an image processing apparatus that allows a user to select a region of a web page as desired. According to an aspect of the present invention, an image processing apparatus includes a determination unit configured to determine coordinate of a region in a web page having a plurality of elements in a structured document, the display region being specified by a user, an extraction unit configured to extract image data corresponding to the coordinate determined by the determination unit in the web page, an output unit configured to output an image based on the image data extracted by the extraction unit, wherein, when the region specified by the user is a part clipped out of an element in the web page, the extraction unit extracts image data of the part of the element corresponding to the coordinate determined by the determination unit. Further features and aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.",
