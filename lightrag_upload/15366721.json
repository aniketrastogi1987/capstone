  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A method includes receiving from a first digital object management system a message requesting a transfer of management responsibilities for a digital object representing an asset from the first digital object management system to a second digital object management system. The method also can include, responsive to receiving the message requesting the transfer of the management responsibilities for the digital object representing the asset from the first digital object management system to the second digital object management system, retrieving the digital object from the first digital object management system, performing at least one operation updating data contained within the digital object by executing, using a first processor, at least a first application contained within the digital object, and communicating the digital object to the second digital object management system for storage in a digital object database. A system includes at least a first processor programmed to initiate executable operations. The executable operations include receiving from a first digital object management system a message requesting a transfer of management responsibilities for a digital object representing an asset from the first digital object management system to a second digital object management system. The executable operations also can include, responsive to receiving the message requesting the transfer of the management responsibilities for the digital object representing the asset from the first digital object management system to the second digital object management system, retrieving the digital object from the first digital object management system, performing at least one operation updating data contained within the digital object by executing at least a first application contained within the digital object, and communicating the digital object to the second digital object management system for storage in a digital object database.
