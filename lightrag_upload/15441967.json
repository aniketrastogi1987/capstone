  "abstract": "A system, a machine-readable storage medium storing instructions, and a computer-implemented method as described herein are directed to a Fast Ranker Engine that identifies global model features present in an article in a social network service. The Fast Ranker Engine assembles respective fixed vectors based on at least one member account feature and each coefficient that corresponds to a present global article feature of the global model. The Fast Ranker Engine generates a transformation feature(s) for a prediction model of the article based on the respective fixed vectors.",
