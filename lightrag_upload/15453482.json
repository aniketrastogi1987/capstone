  "abstract": "Learning data of a usage environment can be efficiently collected. A recognition apparatus includes: a first neural network configured to receive input of data; a second neural network configured to receive input of the data, the second neural network having a different structure from a structure of the first neural network; a comparison unit configured to compare a first output result of the first neural network and a second output result of the second neural network; and a communication unit configured to wirelessly transmit the data to a host system configured to learn the data when a comparison result between the first output result and the second output result is different by a predetermined standard or more.",
