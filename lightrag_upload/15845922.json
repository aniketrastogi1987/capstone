  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present disclosure is directed to determining appropriately a label when a false label is applied by learning data. An information processing apparatus according to the present disclosure includes an obtaining unit configured to obtain information of a plurality of labels applied to the learning data by a plurality of users, information regarding reliability of each applied label itself, and information regarding reliability of a user who applies the relevant label, wherein the information of the label is information regarding a result to be recognized in a case where the predetermined recognition is performed on the learning data and a determination unit configured to determine a label to the learning data from among the plurality of labels based on the reliability of the label itself and the reliability of the user who applies the relevant label. Further features of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.",
