  "abstract": "A phase of a specific frequency component of an image of a grid image on the surface of an object taken by a camera is found, and the location of the surface of the object is found from the phase. As a result, measurement that is strong against noise can be carried out without projecting a grid having a brightness distribution of precise cosine waves. In addition, the process is simple and can be used for the surface of a moving object. The number of pixels used for the measurement is smaller than that in the sampling moire method.",
