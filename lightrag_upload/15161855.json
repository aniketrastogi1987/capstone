  "abstract": "Embodiments of a system for determining personal attributes based on public interaction data are illustrated. In one embodiment, the system employs a process for predicting personal attributes based on public interaction data by constructing matrices based on user interactions drawn from public posts on a social media website. The process may further learn a compact representation for a plurality of users based on public posts using the matrices, extract the compact representation of one or more users that have been labeled, and apply a classifier to learn about a particular personal attribute. Through this, a prediction of personal attributes of users that have not been labeled may be obtained.",
