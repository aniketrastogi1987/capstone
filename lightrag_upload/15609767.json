  "abstract": "An individual ising device connected to common buses includes neuron circuits, a memory, and a router. The memory holds connection destination information per neuron circuit. An individual item of connection destination information includes first address information identifying one of a plurality of connection destination neuron circuits of a neuron circuit and second address information identifying a first ising device including at least one of the connection destination neuron circuits, the first and second address information being correlated. The router supplies, when an output signal of a connection destination neuron circuit changes and when the router receives the first address information identifying this connection destination neuron circuit via a bus, an update signal based on the changed output signal to one of the neuron circuits in accordance with the received first address information, the previously specified second address information identifying the first ising device,...",
