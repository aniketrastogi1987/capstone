  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a computing apparatus having at least one microprocessor and memory storing instructions configured to instruct the at least one microprocessor to perform operations, the computing apparatus comprising a system configured to receive input from a plurality of users using a plurality of different interface formats; wherein transferred data includes grades; wherein a data transfer may be initiated through a provided interface without knowledge of the required format of other users; wherein said system is configured to convert said information provided in one format into the format required by a user; and wherein said system is configured to allow for a plurality users to push and/or pull data from said system. In one embodiment the present disclosure provides a method of managing grade or assignment information transfer between a plurality of users comprising receiving said information from said users; converting format of said information into format required by other users; providing said information to said other users. It is contemplated that any embodiment of a method or composition described herein can be implemented with respect to any other method or composition described herein. The use of the word “a” or “an” when used in conjunction with the term “comprising” in the claims and/or the specification may mean “one,” but it is also consistent with the meaning of “one or more,” “at least one,” and “one or more than one.” The use of the term “or” in the claims is used to mean “and/or” unless explicitly indicated to refer to alternatives only or the alternative are mutually exclusive, although the disclosure supports a definition that refers to only alternatives and “and/or.” Throughout this application, the term “about” is used to indicate that a value includes the standard deviation of error for the device or method being employed to determine the value. As used in this specification and claim(...",
