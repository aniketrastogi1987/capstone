  "abstract": "Described herein is a framework for classifying social media inputs. In accordance with one aspect of the framework, one or more social media inputs is acquired from one or more social media platforms. The social media inputs are cleaned to remove redundant elements. One or more features are extracted from the cleaned social media inputs. The social media inputs are classified by a trained classifier into predefined categories using the extracted one or more features.",
