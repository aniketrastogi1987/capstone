  "abstract": "A method and associated system for automatically deriving context of a business rule that is being inferred from an information source, such as legacy computer-program source code, a system specification, or a description of a business function or operation. A first generation of context-dependent conditions upon the business rule is identified by analyzing the information source and other, related, sources, and the business rule is modified to account for this first generation of context-dependent conditions. Context-dependent conditions that place constraints upon the previously identified first-generation conditions are then identified and the business rule is further modified to account for this next generation of context-dependent conditions. This process repeats iteratively through multiple generations of identifications, until the business rule has been modified to accommodate all contextual information that may be gleaned from all analyzed information sources. These sources may...",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>A first embodiment of the present invention provides a method for automatically deriving a context of a business rule when extracting the business rule from an information source, wherein a context of the business rule indicates an association between the business rule and a context-dependent characteristic of the business rule, the method comprising: a processor of a computer system inferring the business rule as a function of a first element of information, wherein the first element of information is comprised by a first information source; the processor identifying a second element of information that is associated with a first context of the first element of information, wherein the first context indicates an association between the first element and a context-dependent characteristic of the first element, and wherein the second element of information is comprised by a second information source; and the processor modifying the business rule as a function of the second element of information. A second embodiment of the present invention provides a computer program product, comprising a computer-readable hardware storage device having a computer-readable program code stored therein, said program code configured to be executed by a processor of a computer system to implement a method for automatically deriving a context of a business rule when extracting the business rule from an information source, wherein a context of the business rule indicates an association between the business rule and a context-dependent characteristic of the business rule, the method comprising: the processor inferring the business rule as a function of a first element of information, wherein the first element of information is comprised by a first information source; the processor identifying a second element of information that is associated with a first context of the first element of information, wherein the first context indicates an association between the fir...",
