  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION <EOH>According to some embodiments, a system for building a model includes a display; a memory storing processor-executable process steps; and a processor to execute the processor-executable process steps to cause the system to: present a user interface on a display, the user interface including one or more user-entry fields to build a model, user-entry fields is associated with a selection of big data or small data for use with the model; receive at least one data source in a user-entry field associated with the model; determine if data in the data source includes big data or small data; and in response to the determination of big data or small data in the data source, execute the model with data from the data source in a big data or small data environment. According to some embodiments, a method for building a model includes presenting a user interface on a display, the user interface including one or more user-entry fields to build a model; receiving at least one data source in a user-entry field associated with the model; determining if data in the data source includes big data or small data; and executing the model with data from the data source in one of a small data environment or a big data environment in response to the determination of big data or small data. According to some embodiments, a non-transitory, computer-readable medium stores instructions that, when executed by a computer processor, cause the computer processor to perform a method for building a model, the method comprising presenting a user interface on a display, the user interface including one or more user-entry fields to build a model, wherein at least one of the user-entry fields is associated with a selection of big data or small data for use with the model; receiving at least one data source in a user-entry field associated with the model; determining if data in the data source includes big data or small data; and executing the model with data from the data sour...",
