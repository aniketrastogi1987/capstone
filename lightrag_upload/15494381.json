  "abstract": "A system for predicting and prescribing actions for impacting policymaking outcomes may include at least one processor configured to access first information scraped from the Internet to identify, for a particular pending policy, information about a plurality of policymakers slated to make a determination on the pending policy. The processor may parse the scraped first information to determine an initial prediction relating to an outcome of the pending policy. The processor may access second information to identify an action likely to change at least one of the initial prediction and the propensity of at least one policymaker, to thereby generate a subsequent prediction corresponding to an increase in a likelihood of achieving the desired outcome. The processor may display to the system user a recommendation to take the action in order to increase the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments consistent with the present disclosure provide systems and methods that incorporate machine-learning and data aggregation techniques to provide policymaking analyses and predictions. The policymaking analyses and predictions may encompass a wide range of policymaking processes (e.g., legislative, regulatory, and judicial processes) and may provide more accurate and targeted predictions. There are many possible applications for such capabilities. For example, organizations that cannot afford analysts, government relations experts, or traditional lobbyists and organizations that engage in in-house lobbying may benefit from the disclosed systems and methods. In addition, the disclosed systems and methods may eliminate redundancies when analyzing data across governmental levels and units. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a hybrid prediction system is disclosed for aggregating electronic data from at least one Internet server and proprietary data, to identify and initially predict an outcome of a future event and to subsequently update the initial prediction. The system may comprise at least one processor configured to execute instructions and a memory storing the instructions. The instructions may comprise instructions to access data scraped from the Internet. The data may be associated with at least one future event. The instructions may further comprise instructions to store the scraped data and determine, from the scraped data, an initial prediction of the outcome of the at least one future event. The instructions may further comprise instructions to generate, from the scraped data, an initial likelihood indication associated with the initial prediction and transmit the initial prediction and the initial likelihood indication to a device. The device may be associated with one or more users. The instructions may further comprise instructions to receive proprietary information, store the proprietary information, and deter...",
