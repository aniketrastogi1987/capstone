  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>An aspect of the present invention provides a method and an apparatus for managing performance of database capable of previously preparing for risk elements of performance and obstacle having a high possibility of occurrence in the future. Further, another aspect of the present invention provides a method and an apparatus for managing performance of database that generate a predictive model so that it is possible to improve a prediction accuracy of risk elements of performance and obstacle having a high possibility of occurrence in the future. According to the present invention as described above, there is an effect capable of previously preparing for risk elements of performance and obstacle having a high possibility of occurrence in the future. Specifically, for example, the present invention has an effect capable of previously predicting and preparing for timing which requires a table reorganization (Reorg), a disc relocation and/or an adjustment of the memory size, using performance-related information of the database. Further, according to the present invention, it is possible to more accurately predict the timing that requires the table reorganization (Reorg), the disc relocation and/or the memory size adjustment, by generating or changing the predictive model when predicting the timing, rather than using a fixed predictive model. Further, when using the present invention, it is possible to block the risk elements of the performance delay of the database in advance, and it is also possible to perform a task for preventing a performance delay, while having a reserve and a plan. In some embodiments, a method for managing performance of database, the method comprising: selecting an object table predicted to be required to perform a table reorganization (Reorg) after the current timing, using performance-related information of database collected for a predetermined time period or more; generating a predictive model for predictin...",
