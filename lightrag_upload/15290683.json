  "abstract": "A system that uses analytics such as prescriptive analytics to formulate a prediction in order to provide a user with a recommendation so that user can make an informed decision. Data may be received for various databases on network computers such as original current manufactured databases, parts databases, diagnostic databases, maintenance databases and location databases. Based on the recommendation, the user interface of a relevant provider is launched so that the user may start a process of the recommendation.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention, wherein in one aspect a system is provided that in some embodiments include various databases that store information about vehicles that can be aggregated and analyzed at a remote computer so that certain conclusions or recommendations can be provided to the user. In accordance with one embodiment, a processor-implemented method of rating a vehicle programmed in a non-transitory processor-readable medium and to execute on one or more processors of a computer configured to execute the method that includes receiving a vehicle search input by a user at a decision computer, receiving information related to vehicle data including previously repairs of the vehicle, location data, and weather data from databases of remote computing devices, wherein the databases dynamically and continuously receive additional vehicle repairs data, location data, and weather data, providing a recommendation based on the vehicle repairs data, location data and weather data, and automatically launching a user interface of a vehicle provider on the decision computer based on the recommendation. In accordance with another embodiment, a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium comprising machine-readable instructions for causing a processor of a computing device to execute a method that includes receiving a vehicle search input by a user, receiving information related to vehicle data including previously repairs of the vehicle, location data, and weather data from databases of remote computing devices, wherein the databases dynamically and continuously receive additional vehicle repairs data, location data, and weather data, providing a recommendation based on the vehicle repairs data, location data and weather data, and automatically launching a user interface of a maintenance provider on the computing device based on the recommendation. In still another embodiment, a system for r...",
