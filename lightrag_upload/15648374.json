In an exemplary embodiment, the device receives a crowd-sourced intra-domain model from a server, where the intra-domain model is a search result re-ranking model generated based on at least device interactions of a plurality of users interacting with a plurality of other devices. The device further generates a re-ranking model from the crowd-sourced intra-domain model and a local model, where the local model includes private data representing a device user's interaction with that device and the re-ranking model is used to re-rank a plurality of search results. In one embodiment, a machine-readable medium having executable instructions to cause one or more processing units to perform a method to generate a re-ranking model used to re-rank a plurality of search results on a client device. In this embodiment, the method receives a crowd-sourced intra-domain model from a server, where the intra-domain model is a search result re-ranking model generated based on at least device interactions of a plurality of users interacting with a plurality of other devices. In addition, the method generates a re-ranking model from the crowd-sourced intra-domain model and a local model, where the local model includes private data representing a device user's interaction with that device and the re-ranking model is used to re-rank a plurality of search results. In one embodiment, the machine-readable medium method receives a crowd-sourced inter-domain model from the server, wherein the crowd-sourced inter-domain model indicates which of the plurality of search domains are to be ranked higher than others in the plurality of search domains. Furthermore, the machine-readable medium method generates the re-ranking model from the crowd-sourced inter-domain model and the local model and the crowd-sourced inte...",
