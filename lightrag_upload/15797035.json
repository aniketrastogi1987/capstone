  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION <EOH>Disclosed is a method that includes receiving data indicative of a plurality of observations of an environment at a control system. Machine learning using deep reinforcement learning is applied to determine an action based on the observations. The deep reinforcement learning applies a convolutional neural network or a deep auto encoder to the observations and applies a training set to locate one or more regions having a higher reward. The action is applied to the environment. A reward token indicative of alignment between the action and a desired result is received. A policy parameter of the control system is updated based on the reward token. The updated policy parameter is applied to determine a subsequent action responsive to a subsequent observation. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative to any of the foregoing embodiments, further embodiments may include where the deep reinforcement learning applies a guided policy search. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative to any of the foregoing embodiments, further embodiments may include where the deep reinforcement learning applies a deep Q-network. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative to any of the foregoing embodiments, further embodiments may include where the updating of the policy parameter is performed in a simulation environment to develop control policies to apply to a physical environment. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative to any of the foregoing embodiments, further embodiments may include where the action controls a nozzle in a coldspray application, and the observations determine a deposit characteristic on a surface. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative to any of the foregoing embodiments, further embodiments may include where the action controls a refurbishing ...",
