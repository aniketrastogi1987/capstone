A probabilistic logical representation is extracted from text data representing a knowledge domain according to an ontology to identify one or more reoccurring problems of the knowledge domain. A root cause and one or more causal factors of the one or more reoccurring problems is automatically identified using the logical representation such that the identifying associates a confidence level for the root cause and the one or more causal factors.",

In one embodiment, by way of example only, a method for root cause identification in audit data, again by a processor, is provided. A probabilistic logic representation is extracted from text data representing a knowledge domain according to an ontology to identify one or more reoccurring problems of the knowledge domain. A root cause and one or more causal factors of the one or more reoccurring problems is automatically identified using the logical representation such that the identifying associates a confidence level for the root cause and the one or more causal factors.",
