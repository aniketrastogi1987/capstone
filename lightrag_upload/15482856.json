  "abstract": "An individual neuron circuit calculates a first value based on a sum of products each obtained by multiplying one of weight values, each representing connection or disconnection between a corresponding neuron circuit and one of the other neuron circuits, by a corresponding one of output signals of the other neuron circuits and outputs 0 or 1, based on a result of comparison between a second value obtained by adding a noise value to the first value and a threshold. An arbitration circuit allows, when first output signals of first neuron circuits interconnected among the neuron circuits simultaneously change based on the weight values, updating of only one of the first output signals of the first neuron circuits and allows, when second output signals of second neuron circuits not interconnected simultaneously change, updating of the second output signals.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to one aspect, there is provided an ising device including: a plurality of neuron circuits which each calculate a first value based on a sum of products each obtained by multiplying one of a plurality of weight values each representing connection or disconnection between a corresponding neuron circuit and one of others of the plurality of neuron circuits, by a corresponding one of a plurality of output signals of the others of the plurality of neuron circuits, and output 0 or 1, based on a result of comparison between a second value obtained by adding a noise value to the first value and a threshold; and an arbitration circuit which allows, when a plurality of first output signals of a plurality of first neuron circuits interconnected among the plurality of neuron circuits simultaneously change based on the plurality of weight values, updating of only one of the first output signals of the plurality of first neuron circuits and allows, when a plurality of second output signals of a plurality of second neuron circuits not interconnected simultaneously change, updating of the plurality of second output signals. The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention.",
