  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 illustrates a system environment of a machine learning system using both user input and machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of task-agnostic machine learning, in an embodiment. FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of a machine learning user input and machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of task-agnostic machine learning, in an embodiment. FIG. 3 is an interaction diagram showing one example of the interactions between various components of a machine learning system, in an embodiment. FIG. 4 illustrates components of an example machine able to read instructions from a machine-readable medium and execute those instructions in a processor. detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"? The figures depict various embodiments for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the embodiments described herein.",
