  "abstract": "To make it possible to perform efficient calculation on large-scale data that cannot be collected at one place or data updated momently. An information processing system 100 includes a plurality of computers 220 having a graph structure as a model, the graph structure being formed by a plurality of vertices corresponding to events as objects of analysis and an edge connecting the corresponding vertices to each other according to relation between the corresponding events, the plurality of computers 220 corresponding to the respective vertices and being connected to each other so as to be able to send and receive data in correspondence with the edge. Each of the computers calculates the transition probability of identifier data between the computer and the computer corresponding to the adjacent vertex connected by the edge, by a predetermined algorithm based on the numbers of pieces of identifier data retained by the mutual computers, and updates the numbers of pieces of identifier data ...",
