  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the present invention provide a system, method, and program product for an adaptive successive warning message handling. A computer receives a plurality of warning messages. The computer determines that a first warning message of the plurality of warning messages was not previously displayed based on determining the first warning message does not match a warning message contained in a previous warning message list. The computer displays the first warning message without an active User Interface (UI) object based on determining that the first warning message was not previously displayed. The computer presents an active UI object after a delay time.",
