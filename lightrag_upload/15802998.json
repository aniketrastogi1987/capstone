  "abstract": "Embodiments of the invention provide a method for mapping a bipartite graph onto a neuromorphic architecture comprising of a plurality of interconnected neuromorphic core circuits. The graph includes a set of source nodes and a set of target nodes. The method comprises, for each source node, creating a corresponding splitter construct configured to duplicate input. Each splitter construct comprises a first portion of a core circuit. The method further comprises, for each target node, creating a corresponding merger construct configured to combine input. Each merger construct comprises a second portion of a core circuit. Source nodes and target nodes are connected based on a permutation of an interconnect network interconnecting the core circuits.",
