  "abstract": "Embodiments of the present invention disclose an in cell touch panel and a method for driving the same, and a display device. According to embodiments of the present invention, a transparent conductive layer is divided into second touch electrodes and common electrodes, that is, a conventional entire common electrode layer is divided into second touch electrodes and common electrodes insulated from each other; accordingly, during a display operation, both the second touch electrodes and the common electrodes are applied with common electrode signals; and, during an touch operation, ones of the first touch electrodes and the second touch electrodes are applied with touch scanning signals while the other ones of the first touch electrodes and the second touch electrodes are coupled to the touch scanning signals and perform outputting, so that a touch function and a display function are achieved by asynchronous drivings. In the in cell touch panel provided according to embodiments of the ...",
