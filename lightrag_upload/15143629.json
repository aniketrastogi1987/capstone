  "abstract": "Knowledge inference apparatus and method to determine emerging industrial trends and adapt strategic reasoning thereof are provided. In some aspects, user data, user stimulus-responses and user tracked data is received at a knowledge inference apparatus from multiple compute devices. The knowledge inference apparatus can generate compressed multidimensional profiles corresponding to multiple users and infer based on the received data, and the compressed multidimensional profiles multiple emerging trends developing in an industry. In some other aspects, the knowledge inference apparatus can further develop individualized strategic information for the multiple users to adequately respond to the inferred emerging trends.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one aspect a knowledge inference apparatus can receive, at the one or more processors, a stimulus-response of a user and user attributes. The knowledge inference apparatus can modify, based on the stimulus-response and the user attributes, a user compressed multidimensional data profile. The knowledge inference apparatus can generate a user performance assessment based on user a compressed multidimensional data profile, the user performance assessment representing a first state in which the user remains with respect to a targeted goal state. The knowledge inference apparatus can execute, based on the user performance assessment, multiple productions rules stored in a knowledge base to generate strategic information to advance the user to a second state closer to the targeted goal state, and send, the strategic information to a compute device corresponding to the at least one user.",
