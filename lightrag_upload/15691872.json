  "abstract": "Systems and methods for determining video infrastructure delivery problems using machine learning are presented. In an aspect, a system includes a reception component configured to receive information regarding videos streamed by the system to devices, wherein the information identifies video playback events at the devices and rebuffer events respectively associated with the video playback events. The system further includes a quality component configured to identify features related to quality of the playback events at the devices based on the information, and an analysis component configured to determine probabilities of occurrence of the re-buffer events based on different combinations of the features, and determine weighted values for each of the features that reflect their contribution to the probabilities of occurrence of the re-buffer events based on the different combinations of the features.",
