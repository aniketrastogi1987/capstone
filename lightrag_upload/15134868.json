  "abstract": "A system for forecasting leaks in a fluid-delivery pipeline network. The system identifies a subsystem in the pipeline network that comprises a plurality of topologically connected stations. The system accesses historical temporal sensor measurements of a plurality of variables of the stations that are directly connected and generates a temporal causal dependency model for a first control variable at the first station in the subsystem, based on the plurality of time series of sensor measurements of a second variable of the first station, and temporal delay characteristics of the plurality of time series of sensor measurements of the second variable at the stations directly connected to the first station. The system automatically calculates a normal operating value of the first control variable at the first station and the deviations between actual measured values and the normal operating value and determines a threshold deviation that indicates a leak event.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>One embodiment of this disclosure is directed to a method for forecasting leaks in a fluid-delivery pipeline network. The method includes identifying a subsystem in the pipeline network, which comprises a plurality of stations that are topologically connected. The method then includes accessing historical temporal sensor measurements of a plurality of variables from the stations in the subsystem that are directly connected. Next, the method includes generating a temporal causal dependency model for a first control variable at the first station in the subsystem, based on the plurality of time series of sensor measurements of a second variable of the first station, and temporal delay characteristics of the plurality of time series of sensor measurements of the second variable at the stations directly connected to the first station. The method further includes automatically calculating a normal operating value of the first control variable at the first station by applying a learning algorithm to train the temporal causal dependency model over a first training period comprising one or more time series of sensor measurements made under normal operating conditions. Then, the method includes calculating deviations between actual measured values of the first control variable at the first station and the normal operating value of the first control variable at the first station over the first training period. Further, the method includes determining a threshold deviation of the first control variable that indicates a leak event by calculating the deviations of the first control variable for a second training period comprising a plurality of time series of sensor measurements made under both normal operating conditions and leak event operating conditions. In one embodiment, the plurality of time series of sensor measurements of a second variable of the plurality of variables at the first station are current values of the sensor measurements....",
