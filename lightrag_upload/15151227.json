  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The present disclosure is directed to an electronic apparatus that can increase the possibility that an operation intended by a user is performed even when an orientation of the apparatus changes while a touch panel is being touched. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an electronic apparatus includes a touch detection unit configured to detect a touch on a display unit, an orientation detection unit configured to detect an orientation of the electronic apparatus, a display control unit configured to perform control to change a display position of a display item displayed on the display unit if a predetermined change of the orientation of the electronic apparatus is detected by the orientation detection unit, and a control unit configured to perform control so that, if the predetermined change of the orientation of the electronic apparatus occurs, processing based on a touch operation of a touch that has been detected by the touch detection unit since before the predetermined change occurs is not performed. An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure can increase the possibility that an operation intended by a user is performed even when an orientation of the apparatus changes while a touch panel is being touched. Further features of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.",
