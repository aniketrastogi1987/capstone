The method also includes initiating, by the processor, based on the predictions, an action to a hardware device to mitigate expected harm to at least one item selected from the group consisting of the hardware device, another hardware device related to the hardware device, and a person related to the hardware device. According to another aspect of the present invention, a system for training a recursive neural network (RNN) is provided. The system includes a processor, wherein the processor is configured to carry out the steps of generating, using the RNN, a plurality of embedding vectors based on a plurality of observations, wherein the observations include (i) a subject, (ii) an action taken by the subject, and (iii) an object on which the subject is taking the action on, wherein the subject and object are constant.
