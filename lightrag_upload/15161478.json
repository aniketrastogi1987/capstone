  "abstract": "Aspects include determination of automated response follow-up. A response to a question is received at a response follow-up system. The response follow-up system analyzes the response using natural language processing to identify one or more response terms. The response follow-up system determines one or more follow-up questions based on the one or more response terms. The response follow-up system modifies an aspect of a user interface based on the one or more follow-up questions.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to an embodiment a method, system, and computer program product for determination of automated response follow-up are provided. The method includes receiving a response to a question at a response follow-up system. The response follow-up system analyzes the response using natural language processing to identify one or more response terms. The response follow-up system determines one or more follow-up questions based on the one or more response terms. The response follow-up system modifies an aspect of a user interface based on the one or more follow-up questions. Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features, refer to the description and to the drawings.",
