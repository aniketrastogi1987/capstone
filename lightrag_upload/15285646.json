  "abstract": "A method and associated systems for a database-management system with artificially intelligent database administration. The DBMS includes one or more databases, each of which is monitored by sensors that detect conditions indicative of database performance. An operational engine receives input from the sensors, translates it into a form understandable by an artificially intelligent decision engine, and forwards the translated input to the decision engine. The decision engine uses preloaded knowledge elements stored in a knowledgebase to infer whether the sensor input identifies an issue that must be resolved by a database-administration activity. If so, the decision engine attempts to select a best solution, optionally seeks confirmation of its selection from an outside source, and directs the operational engine to implement the selected solution. The relative success of the solution is fed back to the knowledgebase, allowing the system, by means of machine learning, to continuously im...",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>One embodiment of the present invention provides a artificially intelligent DBMS system, comprising a processor, a memory coupled to the processor, a local computer-readable hardware storage device coupled to the processor, a set of databases, a set of computer-readable database-storage devices coupled to the processor that each store at least one database of the set of databases, and a set of sensors coupled to the processor that monitor parameters associated with the set of databases, the storage device containing program code configured to be run by the processor via the memory to implement a method for a database-management system with artificially intelligent database administration, the method comprising: the processor of the DBMS system receiving input from a sensor of the set of sensors; the processor determining through artificial intelligence, as a function of information stored in a knowledgebase of the DBMS system, whether the input identifies an issue that adversely affects a functioning of any database of the set of databases; the processor, if determining that the input identifies an issue that adversely affects a functioning of any database of the set of databases: identifying through artificial intelligence, as a function of information stored in the knowledgebase, a set of candidate resolutions to the issue; selecting through artificial intelligence, as a function of information stored in the knowledgebase, a candidate resolution that has a higher confidence of being successful than do other resolutions of the set of candidate resolutions; performing steps of the selected candidate solution upon the set of databases; and updating the knowledgebase as a function of the selecting. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for a database-management system with artificially intelligent database administration, the method comprising: a processor of an artificially intelligent DBMS system receiving input from ...",
