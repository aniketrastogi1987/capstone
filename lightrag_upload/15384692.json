In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a method for recommending content items is provided, the method comprising: determining, using a hardware processor, a plurality of accessed content items associated with a user, wherein each of the plurality of content items is associated with a plurality of topics; determining, using the hardware processor, the plurality of topics associated with each of the plurality of accessed content items; generating a model of user interests based on the plurality of topics, wherein the model implements a machine learning technique to determine a plurality of weights for assigning to each of the plurality of topics; applying, using the hardware processor, the model to determine, for a plurality of content items, a probability that the user would watch a content item of the plurality of content items; ranking, using the hardware processor, the plurality of content items based on the determined probabilities; and selecting a subset of the plurality of content items to recommend to the user based on the ranked plurality of content items. In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a system for recommending content items is provided. The system comprising: a hardware processor that is configured to: determine a plurality of accessed content items associated with a user, wherein each of the plurality of content items is associated with a plurality of topics; determine the plurality of topics associated with each of the plurality of accessed content items; generate a model of user interests based on the plurality of topics, wherein the model implements a machine learning technique to determine a plurality of weights for assigning to each of the plurality of topics; apply the model to determine, for a plurality of con...",
