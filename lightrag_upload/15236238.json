  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>One aspect of the present disclosure relates to a system for content selection with first and second recommendation engines. In some embodiments, the system can include a memory. The memory can include: a content library database and a model database. In some embodiments, the content library database can include a plurality of nodes arranged in a content network. In some embodiments, the nodes in the content network are pairwise connected via a plurality of edges. In some embodiments, some of the nodes in the content network are associated with a data packet and a guard condition. In some embodiments, some of the nodes in the content network are associated with a database of placeholder content. In some embodiments, the model database can include a plurality of models relating to at least one of: a user skill level or a data packet difficulty level, which models can be, for example, statistical models. The system can include a user device. The user device can include a first network interface that can exchange data via a communication network. The user device can include a first I/O subsystem that can convert electrical signals to user interpretable outputs via a user interface. The system can include one or more servers. These one or more servers can include a packet selection system and a presentation system. In some embodiments, the one or more servers can be controlled according to software executed by the one or more servers. In some embodiments, this software can control the server to: receive response data from the user device; provide received response data to a first recommendation engine, and which first recommendation engine can select a next node based on: a current location in the content network, potential next nodes, past response data, and one or several guard conditions associated with the potential next nodes. In some embodiments, the processor can be controlled to: alert a second recommendation engine when a selected next ...",
