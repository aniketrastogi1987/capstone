  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments, nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. According to embodiments of the invention a method for information management related to a problem definition initiative includes receiving a plurality of messages from a plurality of users communicating via a plurality of workstations during a problem definition initiative conference session. The method also includes initiating, by a processing device, an interface to one or more of the plurality of users, comprising initiating display of at least one of the plurality of messages via the interface. The method also includes logging event data related to a plurality of events associated with the problem definition initiative conference session. Initiating presentation of the interface further comprises initiating display of at least some of the event data via the interface. In some embodiments, the event data comprises data corresponding to one or more messages received from one or more users. In some embodiments, the interface comprises a first panel and a second panel, the first panel is configured for displaying at least some of the event data and the second panel is configured for displaying at least one of the plurality of messages. In some embodiments, the plurality of messages comprises a chat session among the plurality of users and wherein the event data corresponds to the chat session, wherein logging the event data comprises logging data related to the chat session and wherein initiating display of at least some of the ...",
