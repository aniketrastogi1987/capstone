  "abstract": "An interactive recommendation system and an interactive recommendation method are provided. The interactive recommendation method includes the following steps. Firstly, a server receives a user request from a user device through the Internet. Then, the server analyzes the user request and generates at least one subsidiary request corresponding to the user request. Then, the server issues an interactive request to the user device according to the at least one subsidiary request. The server generates a recommended application program list according to the at least one subsidiary request. After the user device responds to the interactive request, the server recommends at least one application program in the recommended application program list to the user device.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The disclosure is directed to an interactive recommendation method for use with a user device and a server. The user device and the server are in communication with the Internet. Firstly, the server receives a user request from the user device through the Internet. Then, the server analyzes the user request and generates at least one subsidiary request corresponding to the user request. Then, the server issues an interactive request to the user device according to the at least one subsidiary request. The server generates a recommended application program list according to the at least one subsidiary request. After the user device responds to the interactive request, the server recommends at least one application program in the recommended application program list to the user device. According to one embodiment, an interactive recommendation system for use with a user device is provided. The user device is in communication with the Internet. The interactive recommendation system includes an interaction module and a recommendation module. The interaction module in communication with the Internet. The interaction module receives a user request from the user device through the Internet, analyzes the user request, generates at least one subsidiary request corresponding to the user request, and issues an interactive request to the user device according to the at least one subsidiary request. The recommendation module is in communication with the interaction module. The recommendation module generates a recommended application program list according to the at least one subsidiary request. After the user device responds to the interactive request, the recommendation module recommends at least one application program in the recommended application program list to the user device.",
