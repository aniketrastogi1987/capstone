  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problem occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to determine whether to perform airborne experiments by calculating a seeding line, a seeing period, the amount of seeding and a seeding altitude with consideration taken of an average direction and velocity of the wind when the airborne experiments are performed based on a detailed forecast field provided by the weather center using a numerical model and checking the spread of a seeding material and a distribution (i.e., a target area) of snowfall enhancement attributable to the seeding and to increase a rate of success of the airborne glaciogenic seeding experiments. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method for determining whether to perform airborne glaciogenic seeding experiments through numerical simulations includes a first step for analyzing, by a weather factor analysis unit, weather factors of a target area for airborne glaciogenic seeding experiments, a second step for determining, by an airborne experiment possibility determination unit, whether airborne experiments are possible based on the direction of the wind, the velocity of the wind, temperature and humidity in the target area, a third step for determining, by a seeding information determination unit, seeding information by taking into consideration the direction of the wind and the velocity of the wind, a fourth step for performing, by a numerical simulation execution unit, numerical simulations using the seeding information, a fifth step for displaying and calculating, by an experiment calculation unit, a seeding material spread and distribution field using the results of the numerical simulations, displaying a precipitation increment and a region, and calculating an area, and a sixth step for determining, by a seeding effect determination unit, whether a seeding effect is present or n...",
