  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>One or more specific embodiments herein includes methods for providing an estimated formation pressure comprising modifying a first data set to derive a second data set that corresponds to estimated pressures wherein modifying the first data set comprises using a variable matrix factor and a compaction coefficient. One or more specific embodiments herein includes methods for providing an estimated formation pressure comprising acquiring a first data set, deriving a minimum set of estimated pressures using at least the first data set, a first multiplier, a first variable matrix factor, and a first compaction coefficient, deriving a maximum set of estimated pressures using the first data set, a second multiplier, a second variable matrix factor, and a second compaction coefficient, deriving a plurality of iterations of estimated pressures using the minimum set of estimated pressures and the maximum set of estimated pressures, and selecting at least one of the iterations of estimated pressures to provide an estimated formation pressure. One or more specific embodiments herein includes methods for providing an estimated formation pressure comprising acquiring a sonic data set for a well, acquiring a density data set for the well, deriving a first data set from the sonic data set and deriving a second data set from the density data set, wherein the first data set and the second data set each correspond to estimated pressures and wherein deriving the first data set and the second data set comprises: selecting a multiplier, using the multiplier to derive both a variable matrix factor and a compaction coefficient, and using the variable matrix factor and the compaction coefficient to derive the first data set and the second data set, performing a comparison of the first data set and the second data set, and determining the estimated pressure for one or more depths that corresponds to the actual pressure at those depths based at least in part on the compar...",
