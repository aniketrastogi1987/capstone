  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods for training a neural network that includes a plurality of neural network layers on training data, wherein the neural network is configured to receive time domain features of an audio sample and to process the time domain features to generate a neural network output from the audio sample, wherein the neural network comprises (i) a frequency-transform (F-T) layer that is configured to apply a transformation defined by a set of F-T layer parameters that transforms a window of time domain features into frequency domain features and (ii) one or more other neural network layers having respective layer parameters and are configured to process the frequency domain features to generate the neural network output, and wherein the method includes the actions of obtaining training data comprising, for each of a plurality of training audio samples, time domain features of the training audio sample and a known output for the training audio sample; and training the neural network on the training data to adjust the values of the parameters of the other neural network layers and to adjust the values of the F-T layer parameters to define an optimal transformation from time-domain features to frequency-domain features. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods. A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof installed on the system that in operation may cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, caus...",
