  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In an embodiment, set forth by way of example and not limitation, a method for providing power through a USB port of an electronic device includes connecting a power supply to a USB port of an electronic device, emulating a personal computer (PC) host system such that the electronic device believes that the power supply is a PC host system, retrieving at least one descriptor from the electronic device, identifying the electronic device from the at least one descriptor, and setting a charging voltage based upon the identity of the electronic device. In another embodiment, set forth by way of example and not limitation, a method for providing power through a USB port of an electronic device includes connecting a power supply including digital logic to a USB port of an electronic device, emulating a personal computer (PC) host system using the digital logic such that the electronic device believes that the power supply is a PC host system, retrieving at least one descriptor via the USB port from the electronic device via at least one data line, identifying a maximum voltage level to be provided to the electronic device from the at least one descriptor, and setting a charging voltage of the power supply to the maximum voltage level. In yet another embodiment, set forth by way of example and not limitation, a method for providing power through a USB port of an electronic device includes connecting a power supply including digital logic to a USB port of an electronic device, wherein the USB port includes a VBUS power line, a Dâˆ’ data line and a D+ data line, emulating a personal computer (PC) host system using the digital logic such that the electronic device believes that the power supply is a PC host system, retrieving at least one descriptor via the USB port from the electronic device, wherein the descriptor includes one or more of a Vendor Identification Number (VID), a Product Identification Number (PID), and a code in a text descriptor field, ident...",
