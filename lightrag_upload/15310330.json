  "abstract": "Optimization method and system for supervised learning under tensor mode is provided; wherein the method includes: receiving an input training tensor data set; introducing a within class scatter matrix into an objective function such that between class distance is maximized, at the same time, within class distance is minimized by the objective function; constructing an optimal frame of the objective function of an optimal projection tensor machine OPSTM subproblem; constructing an optimal frame of an objective function of an OPSTM problem; solving the revised dual problem and outputting alagrangian optimal combination and an offset scalar b; calculating a projection tensor W*; calculating a optimal projection tensor W; by the W together with the b, constructing a decision function; inputting to-be-predicted tensor data which has been rank-one decomposed into the decision function for prediction. This overcomes issues such as curse of dimensionality, over learning and small sample occur...",
