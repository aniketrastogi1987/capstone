  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a method of monitoring and displaying the health data of an individual, comprising the steps of: receiving transmitted health parameters of said individual corresponding to outcomes of said individual's health parameter measurements; recording and generating continuous personal health profile based on said health parameters reflective of the current health state of the individual; comparing said personal health profile with a set of predetermined reference parameters to determine where each said personal health profile is corresponding to on a parameter's health scale; providing an indication of said personal health profile if it is in the normal or in-alarm region, as differentiated by predetermined alarm criteria; generating a reward sub-profile for said user who accomplishes an intermediate milestone based on an ultimate goal of associated health parameter measurements; and simultaneously displaying all representative values of the health parameters in a digital and graphical form. It is another object of the present invention to provide a system of monitoring and displaying the health data of an individual, said system comprising: a mobile device for receiving health parameters of said individual corresponding to outcomes of individual's health parameter measurements, said mobile device further comprising: a receiver module operative to accept said transmitted health parameters of said individual corresponding to outcomes of said individual's health parameter measurements; a processor module operative to record and generate continuous personal health profile based on said health parameters reflective of the current health state of the individual and compare said personal health profile with a set of predetermined reference parameters to determine where each said personal health profile is corresponding to on a parameter's health scale; a user interface module operative t...",
