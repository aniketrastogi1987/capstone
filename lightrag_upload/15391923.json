  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method for conducting classification model training. The method includes: acquiring sample feature vectors of a plurality of users according to at least one feature set for each of the users, wherein the at least one feature set for a user is determined based on at least one sample message of the user; determining gender identifiers of the users according to the sample feature vectors; and conducting training based on the sample feature vectors and the gender identifiers corresponding to the sample feature vectors to construct a gender classification model. According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a device including a processor and a memory configured to store instructions executable by the processor. The processor is configured to: acquire sample feature vectors of a plurality of users according to at least one feature set for each of the users, wherein the at least one feature set for a user is determined based on at least one sample message of the user; determine gender identifiers of the users according to the sample feature vectors; and conduct training based on the sample feature vectors and the gender identifiers corresponding to the sample feature vectors to construct a gender classification model. According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a non-transitory readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor of a device, cause the device to perform a method for conducting classification model training, the method including: acquiring sample feature vectors of a plurality of users according to at least one feature set for each of the users, wherein the at least one feature set for a user is determined based on at least one sample message of the user; determining gender identifiers of the users according to the sample feature vectors; and conducting training based on the sample featu...",
