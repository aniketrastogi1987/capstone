  "abstract": "A neural system comprises multiple neurons interconnected via synapse devices. Each neuron integrates input signals arriving on its dendrite, generates a spike in response to the integrated input signals exceeding a threshold, and sends the spike to the interconnected neurons via its axon. The system further includes multiple noruens, each noruen is interconnected via the interconnect network with those neurons that the noruen's corresponding neuron sends its axon to. Each noruen integrates input spikes from connected spiking neurons and generates a spike in response to the integrated input spikes exceeding a threshold. There can be one noruen for every corresponding neuron. For a first neuron connected via its axon via a synapse to dendrite of a second neuron, a noruen corresponding to the second neuron is connected via its axon through the same synapse to dendrite of the noruen corresponding to the first neuron.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of structural plasticity in spiking neural networks with symmetric dual of an electronic neuron are provided herein. In one embodiment, the invention provides a neural system comprising multiple neuron devices interconnected via an interconnect network comprising a plurality of synapse devices. Each neuron integrates input signals arriving on its dendrite, generates a spike signal in response to the integrated input signals exceeding a threshold, and sends the spike signal to the interconnected neurons via its axon. The system further comprises multiple noruen devices corresponding to the neurons, each noruen comprising a symmetric dual of a neuron. Each noruen is interconnected via the interconnect network with those neurons that the noruen's corresponding noruen sends its axon to. Each noruen integrates input spike signals from connected spiking neurons and generates a spiking signal in response to the integrated input spike signals exceeding a threshold. In another embodiment the present invention provides a neural system comprising a neuron network of multiple neuron devices interconnected via a forward interconnect network including a plurality of synapses. Each neuron integrates input signals arriving on its dendrite, generates a spike signal in response to the integrated input signals exceeding a threshold, and sends the spike signal to the interconnected neurons via its axon. The system further comprises a noruen network of multiple noruen devices connected to the neuron network via the interconnect network, one noruen for every corresponding noruen, wherein each noruen comprises a symmetric dual of a neuron. For a first neuron that is connected via its axon through a synapse to dendrite of a second neuron, a noruen corresponding to the second neuron is connected via its axon through the same synapse to dendrite of the neuron corresponding to the first neuron. Each neuron integrating input spike signals from connected spi...",
