  "abstract": "The present invention extends to methods, systems, and computer program products for using virtual data to test and train parking space detection systems. Aspects of the invention integrate a virtual driving environment with sensor models (e.g., of a radar system) to provide virtual radar data in relatively large quantities in a relatively short amount of time. The sensor models perceive values for relevant parameters of a training data set. Relevant parameters can be randomized in the recorded data to ensure a diverse training data set with minimal bias. Since the driving environment is virtualized, the training data set can be generated alongside ground truth data. The ground truth data is used to annotate true locations, which are used to train a parking space classification algorithms to detect the free space boundaries.",
