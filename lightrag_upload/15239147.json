  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE <EOH>It is an object of the present disclosure to at least partially solve the problems in the conventional technology. An image-processing apparatus according to one aspect of the present disclosure is an image-processing apparatus including a statistical information storage unit that stores temporal statistical information of read images read by an image-reading apparatus, a scan information acquiring unit that acquires scan information of the read images read by the image-reading apparatus, a temporal change data generating unit that generates temporal change data based on the statistical information and the scan information, a threshold determining unit that determines whether the temporal change data satisfy a threshold, and an information outputting unit that outputs notice information when the threshold determining unit determines that the temporal change data fail to satisfy the threshold. An image-processing method according to another aspect of the present disclosure is an image-processing method including a scan information acquiring step of acquiring scan information of read images read by an image-reading apparatus, a temporal change data generating step of generating temporal change data based on temporal statistical information of the read images read by the image-reading apparatus and the scan information, a threshold determining step of determining whether the temporal change data satisfy a threshold, and an information outputting step of outputting notice information when the temporal change data are determined as failing to satisfy the threshold at the threshold determining step. A computer program product according to still another aspect of the present disclosure is a computer program product having a non-transitory tangible computer readable medium including programmed instructions for causing, when executed by a computer, the computer to perform an image-processing method including a scan information acquiring s...",
