An example method includes accessing a first alert sequence from a work vehicle, the first alert sequence is associated with one or more of observed diagnostic code, observed vehicle sensor data, or observed vehicle status data; comparing the first alert sequence to a model including an association between reference alert sequences, reference machine failures, and probable parts used to repair the respective reference machine failures; identifying a substantial similarity between the first alert sequence and a first reference alert sequence of the reference alert sequences; and based on the model and the first reference alert sequence, identifying first probable parts of the probable parts used to repair a first reference machine failure of the reference machine failures, where the first reference machine failure is associated with the first reference alert sequence.",
