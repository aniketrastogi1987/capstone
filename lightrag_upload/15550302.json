  "abstract": "This disclosure relates to learning from distributed data. In particular, it relates to determining multiple first training samples from multiple first data samples. Each of the multiple first data samples comprises multiple first feature values and a first label that classifies that first data sample. A processor determines each of the multiple first training samples by selecting a first subset of the multiple first data samples such that the first subset comprises data samples with corresponding one or more of the multiple first feature values, and combining the first feature values of the data samples of the first subset based on the first label of each of the first data samples of the first subset. The resulting training samples can be combined with training samples from other databases that share the same corresponding features and entity matching is unnecessary.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 illustrates a prior art scenario of a data aggregator storing an individual's data on separate databases. An example will be described with reference to FIG. 2 illustrates a computer system 200 for learning from distributed data. FIG. 3 illustrates two dataset that are to be fused. FIG. 4 illustrates a method for determining training samples from data samples of one of the datasets of FIG. 3 . FIG. 5 illustrates a method for determining multiple combined training samples from multiple training samples. FIG. 6 illustrates an algorithm for logistic regression. FIG. 7 illustrates an algorithm for sampling of blocked observations. FIG. 8 illustrates an algorithm for data fusion and learning. detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?",
