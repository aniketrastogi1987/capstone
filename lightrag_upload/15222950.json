  "abstract": "A machine learning unit capable of judging the necessity of replacement of a spindle of a machine tool. A machine learning unit includes a state observing section observing a state variable comprising processing volume data showing a number of processed workpieces, processing accuracy data showing a difference between an actual dimension of a processed workpiece and a dimension target value, interruption time data showing a time period of interruption of operation of the machine tool, and replacement determination data showing a judgment result of a necessity of spindle replacement; and a learning section provided with profit-and-loss data comprising a profit per unit time or a loss per unit time, generated by a production of the processed workpiece, and a loss per unit time generated due to the spindle replacement. The learning section uses the profit-and-loss data and the state variable and learns a condition associated with the spindle replacement.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>It is desirable to make it possible to correctly judge whether or not the extent of an abnormal operation of a spindle of a machine tool exceeds an allowable range, and therefore, whether or not it is necessary to replace the spindle with a new one, without relying on a detection value which is easily affected by disturbance, such as the detected value of a vibration sensor. One aspect of the present invention is a machine learning unit configured to learn a condition associated with replacement of a spindle of a machine tool, the machine learning unit comprising a state observing section configured to observe a state variable representing a current state of a spindle, during a continuous operation of a machine tool, the state variable comprising processing volume data showing a total number of processed workpieces which are processed using the spindle, processing accuracy data showing a difference between an actual dimension of a processed workpiece and a dimension target value, interruption time data showing a time period of interruption of operation of the machine tool, and replacement determination data showing a judgment result of a necessity of spindle replacement; and a learning section provided with profit-and-loss data, the profit-and-loss data comprising a profit per unit time or a loss per unit time, which may be generated by a production of the processed workpiece, and a loss per unit time which may be generated due to the spindle replacement, the learning section configured to use the profit-and-loss data and the state variable and learn a condition associated with the spindle replacement. Another aspect of the present invention is a spindle replacement judging device configured to judge a necessity of replacement of a spindle of a machine tool, the spindle replacement judging device comprising a machine learning unit according to the aforementioned aspect; and a decision making section configured to output an action ...",
