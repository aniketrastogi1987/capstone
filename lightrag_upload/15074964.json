  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Implementations generally relate to updating event information in posts to users in a social network system. In some implementations, a method includes receiving location data related to a location of a first user, and receiving temporal data corresponding to a time when the first user is at the location. The method also includes generating one or more event objects having an event information section associated with the first user; and the event information section is based on the location data and the temporal data. The method also includes sending a post from the first user to one or more target users in a social network system, updating the one or more event objects based on the event information section, and causing the one or more event objects to be displayed along with the post to the one or more target users in the social network system. In some implementations a method includes generating one or more event objects having an event information section associated with a first user. The method also includes sending a post from the first user to one or more target users in a social network system, updating the one or more event objects based on the event information section, and causing the one or more updated event objects to be displayed along with the post to the one or more target users in the social network system. With further regard to the method, in some implementations, the method also includes receiving location data related to a location of a first user with the first user's consent, where the location data is provided by activity data associated with one or more actions of the user. With further regard to the method, in some implementations the method also includes receiving temporal data corresponding to activity data associated with one or more actions of the first user. With further regard to the method, in some implementations, the method also includes receiving location data from a global positioning system (GPS) sensor inclu...",
