  "abstract": "An arithmetic apparatus used for a neural network includes a plurality of digital-time conversion circuits connected in series and a time-digital conversion circuit connected to a last digital-time conversion circuit in the series. Each of the digital-time conversion circuits is configured to delay a first input time signal by a variable amount, delay a second input time signal by a fixed amount, and output the delayed first and second input time signals respectively as either first and second output time signals or second and first output time signals, in accordance with the input data. The time-digital conversion circuit is configured to generate a digital output signal by comparing first and second output time signals from the last digital-time conversion circuit.",
