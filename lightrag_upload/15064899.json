  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to an aspect of the invention, a portable device includes: a first interface circuit configured to receive, from an information processing apparatus, device information of the information processing apparatus; a second interface circuit configured to receive, from outside device through wireless communication link, a start signal for the information processing apparatus; a memory configured to store a list of information processing apparatuses that are to be permitted to perform wireless communication with the portable device; and a processor configured to compare the device information received from the information processing apparatus with the list stored in the memory, enable wireless communication functionality of the second interface circuit when a result of the comparison indicates that the portable device is coupled to an information processing apparatus which is permitted to perform wireless communication, and transmit a start signal to the information processing apparatus when the start signal is received by using the enabled wireless communication functionality. The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed",
