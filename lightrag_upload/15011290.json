  "abstract": "Aspects of state estimation for cooperative electrical grids are disclosed. State estimation of a local electrical grid can be based on a local grid model and local electrical grid information. The local state estimation can reflect interactions and interconnections with other electrical grids by determining state estimation solution information based on the local grid model, local electrical grid information, and remote state estimator solution information associated with the other electrical grid. As such, a local state estimator can be configured to receive and employ remote state estimator solution information. This can be in addition to the more conventional technique or receiving a remote grid model and remote electrical grid information to estimate the conditions of the remote electrical grid. Further, state estimation solution information can be incremental to further reduce the amount of information to be transferred and the time needed to accomplish transmission of the inform...",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosed subject matter in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed subject matter. This summary is not an extensive overview of the subject disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the subject disclosure nor delineate the scope of the disclosed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. One or more embodiments of the disclosed subject matter illustrate state estimation for cooperative electrical grids. A system facilitating state estimation for cooperative electrical grids can include a memory and processor. The memory can store computer-executable instructions such that the processor can execute the instructions to at least determine a first state estimator solution information. The determination of the first state estimator solution information can be based on a first model of a first electrical grid, first electrical grid information associated with the first electrical grid, and second state estimator solution information associated with a second electrical grid. In another non-limiting aspect, a method is disclosed that can facilitate state estimation for cooperative electrical grids. The method can include receiving a first model of a first electrical grid. The method can then include determining a first state estimator solution information. The determining can be based on the first model, first electrical grid information associated with the first electrical grid, and second state estimator solution information associated with a second electrical grid. A further embodiment of the disclosed subject matter can include a computer-readable storage medium having computer-executable instructions stored thereon that, in response to execution, cause a computing device including a processor to ...",
