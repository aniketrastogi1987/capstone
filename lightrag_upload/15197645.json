  "abstract": "A management system for guiding an agent in a media-specific dialogue has a conversion engine for instantiating ongoing dialogue as machine-readable text, if the dialogue is in voice media, a context analysis engine for determining facts from the text, a rules engine for asserting rules based on fact input, and a presentation engine for presenting information to the agent to guide the agent in the dialogue. The context analysis engine passes determined facts to the rules engine, which selects and asserts to the presentation engine rules based on the facts, and the presentation engine provides periodically updated guidance to the agent based on the rules asserted.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The present inventors, having considerable experience in contact-center systems, have determined that agent-guidance systems in contact centers are woefully inadequate, and that enterprises suffer unnecessary problems and expense as a result. The inventors have therefore provided greatly enhanced functionality for such guidance systems. In one embodiment of the present invention a management system for guiding an agent in a media-specific dialogue is provided, comprising a conversion engine for instantiating ongoing dialogue as machine-readable text, if the dialogue is in voice media, a context analysis engine for determining facts from the text, a rules engine for asserting rules based on fact input, and a presentation engine for presenting information to the agent to guide the agent in the dialogue. The context analysis engine passes determined facts to the rules engine, which selects and asserts to the presentation engine rules based on the facts, and the presentation engine provides periodically updated guidance to the agent based on the rules asserted. In another aspect a method for guiding an agent in a media-specific dialogue is provided, comprising steps of (a) if the dialogue is voice, converting the voice to machine-readable text; (b) analyzing the text by context analysis engine and determining facts from the text; (c) passing the determined facts to a rules engine and asserting rules based on the fact input; and (d) presenting new guidance information to the agent to guide the agent in the dialogue.",
