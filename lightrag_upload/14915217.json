  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure, a method to consolidate computation tasks associated with a plurality of virtual machines running on one or more host devices is disclosed. The method includes forming a pipeline having at least a first core and a second core after having detected a formation condition, identifying a first set of operations of a first virtual machine running on a first host device that are similar to a second set of operations of a second virtual machine running on a second host device, identifying a third set of operations of the first virtual machine that are similar to a fourth set of operations of the second virtual machine, dispatching the first set of operations and the second set of operations to the first core of the pipeline for execution, and dispatching the third set of operations and the fourth set of operations to the second core of the pipeline for execution. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure, a non-transitory computer readable medium embodying executable instructions is disclosed. The executable instructions, in response to execution by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method to consolidate computation tasks associated with a plurality of virtual machines running on one or more host devices. The method includes identifying a first set of operations of a first virtual machine running on a first host device that are similar to a second set of operations of a second virtual machine running on a second host device, identifying a third set of operations of the first virtual machine that are similar to a fourth set of operations of the second virtual machine, dispatching the first set of operations and the second set of operations to a first core of a pipeline for execution, and dispatching the third set of operations and the fourth set of operations to a second core of the pipeline for execution The foregoing summary is illustrative o...",
