  "abstract": "Methods and devices for provisioning a secure application on an electronic device with first issuer data for a first issuer are described. In an embodiment, the provisioning system receives and stores first issuer records. The example provisioning system receives a provisioning request to provision the secure application with the first issuer data. The provisioning request includes identifying information. The example provisioning system evaluates the provisioning request based on at least one of the first issuer evaluation criteria, the first issuer records and the identifying information in the provisioning request. When the provisioning request satisfies the first issuer evaluation criteria, the example provisioning system generates a signal using the communication module to provide the first issuer data to the electronic device to provision the secure application on the electronic device.",
