  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one example embodiment, a method may include monitoring contents of communications between a first user and a second user, determining a degree of closeness between the first user and the second user utilizing an ontological model, with the degree of closeness being based at least in part on the contents of communications between the first user and the second user, and updating the degree of closeness based at least in part on a frequency of communications between the first user and the second user. In another example embodiment, a computer-readable medium may store instructions that, when executed, cause one or more processors to perform operations that include establishing an ontological model that indicates a degree of closeness between a first user and a second user, analyzing a content of a first communication between the first user and the second user, determining a degree of closeness between the first user and the second user using the ontological model and a result of the analysis, and decaying the degree of closeness between the first user and the second user until an occurrence of a second communication between the first user and the second user. In yet another example embodiment, a system may comprise a first component that is configured to determine a degree of closeness between a first user and a second user utilizing an ontological model, with the degree of closeness being based at least in part on contents of communications between the first user and the second user, and a second component that is configured to update the degree of closeness based on a pattern of communications between the first user and the second user. The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.",
