  "abstract": "A feature calculation unit 81 calculates a feature that is likely to influence cancellation by a user based on a communication state log that indicates a communication state of a base station when the user has been engaged in communication or making a call. A learning device 82 learns a model representing a behavioral characteristic of the user by using the calculated feature as an explanatory variable. A prediction device 83 predicts the behavioral characteristic of the user using the feature generated from the communication state log and the model.",
