  "abstract": "Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage media, for identifying answers to questions using neural networks. One of the methods includes receiving an input text passage and an input question string; processing the input text passage using an encoder neural network to generate a respective encoded representation for each passage token in the input text passage; at each time step: processing a decoder input using a decoder neural network to update the internal state of the decoder neural network; and processing the respective encoded representations and a preceding output of the decoder neural network using a matching vector neural network to generate a matching vector for the time step; and generating an answer score that indicates how well the input text passage answers a question posed by the input question string.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving an input passage and an input question string; and processing the input passage and the input question string using a neural network system to generate an answer score that indicates how well the input text passage answers the question posed by the input question string, wherein the neural network system includes an encoder neural network, a decoder neural network, and a matching vector neural network. In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving an input passage; and processing the input passage using a neural network system to generate an output question string that poses a question that is answered by the input passage, wherein the neural network system includes an encoder neural network, a decoder neural network, and a matching vector neural network. Other embodiments of these aspects include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods. A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof installed on the system that in operation may cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions. Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a computer system that includes an encoder neural network, a decoder neural network, a matching vector neural network. The encoder neural network is configured to r...",
