  "abstract": "Maximally entangled particle groups, organized into defined, shaped pulses, and patterns made up of these shaped pulses are described. Using the system and method of the present disclosure, a first group of maximally entangled particles is maximally entangled with another, second group of maximally entangled particles forming at least two groups of maximally entangled particles. These two groups are maximally entangled inter-group and maximally entangled intra-group. These groups can be manipulated in a quantum device to provide virtually error free logic in a quantum computing device, as compared to single particle manipulation, which suffers from data loss and decoherence.",
