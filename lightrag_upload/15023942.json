  "abstract": "According to one configuration, upon receiving data, a respective node in a distributed storage system produces metadata based on the received data. The generated metadata indicates whether or not to bypass storage of the received data in the cache storage resource and store the received data in the non-cache storage resource of the repository. Data storage control logic uses the metadata to control how the received data is stored. A state of the metadata can indicate to prevent storage of the received data in a corresponding cache resource associated with the respective storage node. Thus, the generated metadata can provide guidance to corresponding data storage control logic whether to store the received data in a cache storage resource or non-cache storage resource.",
