  "abstract": "System and techniques for an embedded sensor model are described herein. A message that includes a model identifier field, a performance label, a sensor set, and a first user identification field containing a user identification is obtained. A set of feedback packages is obtained. A feedback package includes a value and indicates the user identification. Feedback package values are aggregated to create a weight for the user identification. A training set is applied to a model to create a new model. This includes modifying model training with respect to the sensor set based on the performance label and the weight. The new model may then be transmitted to a user device. The new model providing a sensor classifier for a sensor monitoring user activity.",
