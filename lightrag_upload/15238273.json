  "abstract": "A system includes a knowledge canvassing system executed by a computer, a processor, and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory is encoded with instructions that when executed cause the processor to provide a training system for generating benchmark data for the knowledge canvassing system. The training system is configured to resolve a first entity to an entry in a knowledge base of reference documents, identify a second entity included in the entry, and assign a weight to the second entity based on a location of the second entity in the entry or a number of mentions of the second entity in the entry.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to an embodiment, a method for generating benchmark data for a knowledge canvassing system includes resolving, by a training system executing on a computer, an entity to an entry in a knowledge base of reference documents. In an embodiment of the method, the resolving may include matching the title of the entry in the knowledge base of reference documents to the entity. The method also includes identifying, by the training system, a plurality of entities included in the entry. In an embodiment of the method, the identifying may include running an information extraction tool over the entry. The method also includes assigning, by the training system, weights to each of the plurality of entities based on a location of each of the plurality of entities in the entry or a number of mentions of each of the plurality of entities in the entry. In an embodiment of the method, a first entity of the plurality of entities may be assigned a larger weight than a second entity of the plurality of entities if a determination is made that the first entity is located prior to the second entity in the entry. In an embodiment of the method, entities of the plurality of entities included in the entry may be assigned a weight equal to 1 n , where n is a paragraph number in the entry where the entity first occurs. In another embodiment of the method, a first entity of the plurality of entities may be assigned a larger weight than a second entity of the plurality of entities if a determination is made that the first entity occurs more often than the second entity in the entry. In an embodiment of the method, entities of the plurality of entities included in the entry may be assigned an initial weight of 0 and for each paragraph that each entity occurs in the entry an incremental weight equal to 1 n is added to the initial weight to generate a total weight, where n is a paragraph number in the entry where each entity occurs in the entry. In another embodiment, a ...",
