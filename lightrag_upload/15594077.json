  "abstract": "Embodiments relate to performing inference, such as object recognition, based on sensory inputs received from sensors and location information associated with the sensory inputs. The sensory inputs describe one or more features of the objects. The location information describes known or potential locations of the sensors generating the sensory inputs. An inference system learns representations of objects by characterizing a plurality of feature-location representations of the objects, and then performs inference by identifying or updating candidate objects consistent with feature-location representations observed from the sensory input data and location information. In one instance, the inference system learns representations of objects for each sensor. The set of candidate objects for each sensor is updated to those consistent with candidate objects for other sensors, as well as the observed feature-location representations for the sensor.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments relate to performing inference by generating input representations of location and feature pairs, and generating output representations indicating candidates likely to be associated with the location and feature pairs. A first input processor generates a first input representation indicating potential of a first pair of a first location and a first feature at the first location being detected. A first output processor determines a first output representation corresponding to the first input representation. The first output representation indicates one or more candidates likely to be associated with the first pair. The first input processor generates a second input representation indicating potential of a second pair of a second location and a second feature at the second location subsequent to generating the first input representation. The first output processor determines a second output representation corresponding to the first input representation and the second input representation. The second output representation indicates one or more candidates likely to be associated with the first pair and the second pair. In one embodiment, a feedback signal representing a prediction on the second input representation is generated in the first output processor based on the first output representation. The second input representation is generated in the first input processor based further on the feedback signal. In one embodiment, an output representation corresponding to a cause is maintained active in the first output processor during training. Training input representations for pairs of locations and corresponding features associated with the cause for the training are generated in the first input processor. The training input representations are associated with the output representation corresponding to the cause. In one embodiment, the first input representation is an activation state of a first subset of input cells in the first input pr...",
