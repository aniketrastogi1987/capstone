  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and advantages are provided through the provision of a computer-implemented method of performing processing associated with transactional execution in a computing environment. The computer-implemented method includes, for instance, obtaining, by a processor, an instruction to be executed as part of a transaction; computing one or more effective controls from one or more controls set by one or more transaction begin instructions, wherein the one or more effective controls comprises an effective allow access register modification control that indicates whether an access register is permitted to be modified; determining by the processor whether the instruction is a selectively restricted instruction that is prohibited from execution within the transaction, the determining being based on the computed one or more effective controls; and performing processing associated with the instruction based on whether the instruction is selectively restricted. Computer program products and systems relating to one or more embodiments are also described and may be claimed herein. Further, services relating to one or more embodiments are also described and may be claimed herein. Additional features and advantages are realized. Other embodiments and aspects are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention.",

  "abstract": "Restricted instructions are prohibited from execution within a transaction. There are classes of instructions that are restricted regardless of type of transaction: constrained or nonconstrained. There are instructions only restricted in constrained transactions, and there are instructions that are selectively restricted for given transactions based on controls specified on instructions used to initiate the transactions.",
