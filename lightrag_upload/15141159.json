  "abstract": "Aspects of the disclosure are directed to a system associated with at least one hotel, comprising a communications infrastructure, and at least one property management computer, where the at least one property management computer is configured to store data related to a guest reservation, the data including an identifier associated with a user device associated with the guest, and where the at least one property management computer is configured to enable the user device to utilize the communications infrastructure based on the identifier. From the perspective of a user/guest of the hotel, the user may use a UD to access one or more services or to engage in one or more communications while at the hotel. Accordingly, the user might not be tethered to a dedicated telephone at the hotel.",
