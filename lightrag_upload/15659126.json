  "abstract": "The various implementations described herein include systems and methods for determining that media items are currently being presented. In one aspect, a method performed at a client device includes: (1) identifying a media item potentially being presented on an output device coupled to the client device; (2) calculating a level of confidence that the identified media item is currently being presented to the user; (3) subsequent to the calculating, determining that at least one predetermined event associated with user interaction with the media item has occurred; and (4) based on the at least one predetermined event, increasing or decreasing the level of confidence that the identified media item is currently being presented to the user.",
