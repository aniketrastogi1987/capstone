  "abstract": "A method for mapping virtual memory pages to physical memory pages is described. The method includes receiving a mapping of a virtual memory page to multiple physical memory pages, detecting a request for a transaction to be performed on data contained in the multiple physical memory pages, in which the transaction includes a number of data updates, determining which of the number of multiple physical memory pages contains a latest version of the data to be updated by the transaction, updating a physical memory page by performing the transaction within a physical memory page among the multiple physical memory pages that does not contain the latest version of the data, and updating an indication of which of the physical memory pages contains the latest version of the data pertaining to the transaction.",
