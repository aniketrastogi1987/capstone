  "abstract": "In one embodiment, a method includes receiving a first selection, from a user, indicative of a first concept, the first concept being defined by the presence or absence of a text string in an unstructured data object or a data code stored in a structured data object. The method further includes receiving a second selection, from a user, the second selection indicative of a second concept, the second concept being defined by the presence or absence of a text string in an unstructured data object or a data code stored in a structured data object. The method further includes determining a relationship between the first concept and the second concept, the relationship based on a number of documents from a plurality of documents that include the first concept and the second concept. The method further includes outputting a visual representation of the relationship to a display.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Intelligence and crime-fighting organizations can use a combination of analytical and graphical techniques to discover and express links (i.e., relatedness) between entities (e.g., people, places and things). Such techniques generally analyze one or more datasets to discover links between the various entities that occur or are mentioned therein. These techniques are often referred to as “link analysis.” During this process, discovered links can be expressed in graphical form to facilitate comprehension of the various entity relationships inherent in the data. For example, discovered links between entities can be expressed via a diagram or illustration that includes two or more nodes connected by a series of lines, with each node representing an entity, and each inter-node line denoting the presence of a link between those two nodes. Such link analysis is typically confined to linking people, places and things based on common attributes that are organized within pre-structured data tables. Such structured data and/or fields include data found in organized columns, tables, spreadsheets, or other data structures, such as relational databases (e.g., Oracle, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL or PostgreSQL relational databases). One currently-accepted method of link analysis is nodal in nature, and involves establishing links between structured data fields included in the tables of a relational database. This traditional link analysis is relatively efficient on organized, structured data, and can be useful in “connecting the dots” for users when expressed visually as described above. There are many limitations to this approach, however. First, the link connections defined by traditional link analysis are confined to the rules of structured databases. Such rules are often ineffective when the analyzed data is multi-faceted, unstructured and/or requires contextual factors for proper linking. Current solutions also often involve reworking of the data in...",
