  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A touch and slide user interface (UI) is provided for entering data into a computer device. The tap and slide alphanumeric entry system may be used on a multi-touch capable device to enter numeric or alphanumeric data in a simpler and/or less obtrusive manner than using a virtual keyboard.",

  "abstract": "A touch and slide user interface (TSUI) is provided for entering data into a computer device. A tap and hold gesture from a first finger on a touch sensitive display screen of the device is detected to initiate the TSUI. A sliding gesture by a second finger touching the touch sensitive display screen is detected. A virtual wheel is rotated on the touch sensitive display screen in response to the sliding gesture, in which the virtual wheel has a set of characters positioned around its edge. Different ones of the set of characters are indicated for selection in response to rotating the virtual wheel. One of the set of characters is selected for inputting to the device by detecting when the second finger is lifted from the touch sensitive screen.",
