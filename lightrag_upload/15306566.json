  "abstract": "Examples relate to changing screen brightness of a computing device. One example enables determination of whether the computing device is being used for one of a set of predetermined application types. The screen brightness of the computing device may be changed based on a set of first brightness values associated with the first predetermined application type responsive to the computing device being used for a first predetermined application type and based on a set of second brightness values associated with the second predetermined application type responsive to the computing device being used for a second predetermined application type.",
