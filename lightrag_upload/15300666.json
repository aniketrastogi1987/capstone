  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF INVENTION <EOH>The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-described problems, and causes an information transmission apparatus to detect the movement of itself, thereby properly maintaining the location of the apparatus. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system including an information transmission apparatus and a mobile terminal, the information transmission apparatus comprising: transmission means for periodically transmitting identification information used to cause the mobile terminal to display predetermined information; detection means for detecting that the information transmission apparatus has moved; and stopping means for, when the detection means detects that the information transmission apparatus has moved, stopping transmission of the identification information by the transmission means, and the mobile terminal comprising: reception means for receiving the identification information; and display means for displaying information corresponding to the identification information when the reception means receives the identification information. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system including an information transmission apparatus and a mobile terminal, the information transmission apparatus comprising: transmission means for periodically transmitting identification information used to cause the mobile terminal to display predetermined information; detection means for detecting that the information transmission apparatus has moved; and change means for, when the detection means detects that the information transmission apparatus has moved, changing the information to be periodically transmitted by the transmission means, and the mobile terminal comprising: reception means for receiving the identification information; and display means for displaying information corresponding to the identification information when the reception means receives t...",
