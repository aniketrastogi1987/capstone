  "abstract": "Regularization of neural networks. Neural networks can be regularized by obtaining an original neural network having a plurality of first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues, each FIFO queue located between a pair of nodes among a plurality of nodes of the original neural network, generating at least one modified neural network, the modified neural network being equivalent to the original neural network with a modified length of at least one FIFO queue, evaluating each neural network among the original neural network and the at least one modified neural network, and determining which neural network among the original neural network and the at least one modified neural network is most accurate, based on the evaluation.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to one aspect of the present invention, provided is a computer-implemented method including obtaining an original neural network having a plurality of first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues, each FIFO queue located between a pair of nodes (also referred to herein as neurons or units) among a plurality of nodes of the original neural network, generating at least one modified neural network, the modified neural network being equivalent to the original neural network with a modified length of at least one FIFO queue, evaluating each neural network among the original neural network and the at least one modified neural network, and determining which neural network among the original neural network and the at least one modified neural network is most accurate, based on the evaluation. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a non-transitory readable storage medium tangibly embodying a computer readable program code having computer readable instructions which, when implemented, cause a computer device to carry out the steps of a method including obtaining an original neural network having a plurality of first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues, each FIFO queue located between a pair of nodes among a plurality of nodes of the original neural network, generating at least one modified neural network, the modified neural network being equivalent to the original neural network with a modified length of at least one FIFO queue, evaluating each neural network among the original neural network and the at least one modified neural network, and determining which neural network among the original neural network and the at least one modified neural network is most accurate, based on the evaluation. According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus including an obtaining section operable to obtain an original neural network having a plurality of first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues, each FIFO queue located...",
