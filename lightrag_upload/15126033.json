  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a display signal input method, comprising: a first step: receiving at least four sub-images formed by dividing an original image; a second step: grouping the received sub-images into a plurality of sub-image groups of a base level, the sub-image group of the base level including at least two sub-image units, and each sub-image unit including at least one sub-image; a third step: judging information of edge matching between every two adjacent sub-image units in each sub-image group of a current level, wherein: if edge matching between the sub-image units in at least one sub-image group of the current level is not correct, respective sub-pixel units are grouped again in a grouping manner different from a grouping manner of the sub-image groups of the current level, and then the third step is repeated; or if edge matching between the respective sub-image units in each sub-image group of the current level is correct, a fourth step is performed; the fourth step: grouping respective sub-image groups of the current level judged in the third step as sub-image units so as to form sub-image groups of a new level, performing the third step with the formed the sub-image groups of the new level as the sub-image groups of the current level till edge matching between any two adjacent sub-images in an image formed by splicing the respective sub-images is correct, and performing a fifth step; and the fifth step: outputting information of the respective sub-images arranged in sequence to a display device, so that the display device can display an image same as the original image. In the above display signal input method, after respective sub-images formed by dividing an original image are received, the plurality of received sub-images are grouped into a plurality of sub-image groups of a base level, in a case edge matching between every two adjacent sub-image units in all the sub-image groups of the base level is cor...",
