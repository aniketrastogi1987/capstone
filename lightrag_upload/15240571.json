  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This disclosure provides a gesture recognition method for virtual reality display output device and a virtual reality display output electronic device to solve the technical problem that there is no gesture recognition with lower cost and good immersion in the VR system of the prior art. According to a first aspect, the present disclosure provides a gesture recognition method for virtual reality display output device, including: acquiring a first video from a first camera, and acquiring a second video from a second camera; separating a first plane gesture associated with first plane information of a first hand graph in the first video from the first video, and separating a second plane gesture associated with second plane information of a second hand graph in the second video from the second video; converting the first plane information and the second plane information into spatial information using a binocular imaging way, and generating a spatial gesture including the spatial information; acquiring an execution instruction corresponding to the spatial gesture; and executing the execution instruction. According to a second aspect, the present disclosure provides a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing executable instructions that, when executed by an electronic device with a touch-sensitive display, cause the electronic device to: acquire a first video from a first camera, and acquiring a second video from a second camera; separate a first plane gesture associated with first plane information of a first hand graph in the first video from the first video, and separating a second plane gesture associated with second plane information of a second hand graph in the second video from the second video; convert the first plane information and the second plane information into spatial information using a binocular imaging way, and generating a spatial gesture comprising the spatial information; acquire an execution instruction correspon...",

  "abstract": "Disclosed are a gesture recognition method for virtual reality display output device and a virtual reality display output electronic device. The recognition method includes: acquiring first and second videos from first and second cameras respectively; separating first and second plane gestures associated with first and second plane information of first and second hand graphs in the first and second video from the first and second videos respectively; converting the first plane information and the second plane information into spatial information using a binocular imaging way, and generating a spatial gesture including the spatial information; acquiring an execution instruction corresponding to the spatial gesture; and executing the execution instruction. The embodiments of the present disclosure can recognize a three-dimensional gesture using an ordinary camera, so as to greatly reduce the cost and technical risks of the virtual reality display output device.",
