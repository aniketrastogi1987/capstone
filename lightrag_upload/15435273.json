  "abstract": "Disclosed herein is a deep learning model that can be used for performing speech or image processing tasks. The model uses multi-task training, where the model is trained for at least two inter-related tasks. For face detection, the first task is face detection (i.e. face or non-face) and the second task is facial feature identification (i.e. mouth, eyes, nose). The multi-task model improves the accuracy of the task over single-task models.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>According to embodiments of the present invention is a method of multi-task learning, involving a single-task and a secondary-task. The single-task focuses on training using information of the main application. The secondary-task, on the other hand, learns features from relative information, which can be anything related to the main purpose. For example, if face detection is to be performed using a multi-task model, the relative information can be landmarks on the face. The combination of features learned from the main and relative information can help improve accuracy in achieving main application. The multi-task model has been applied to neural network for classification. However, the network is shallow, and features extracted are not hierarchical. Embodiments of the present invention focus on the performance of multi-task models in image understanding. The multi-task deep learning model is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Denoising Autoencoder (DA), which can be applied to face detection and object recognition using 3D information (color and depth).",
