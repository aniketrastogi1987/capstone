  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF INVENTION <EOH>According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a machine learning device which learns fault prediction of one of a main shaft of a machine tool and a motor which drives the main shaft, including a state observation unit which observes a state variable including at least one of data output from a motor controller which controls the motor, data output from a detector which detects a state of the motor, and data output from a measuring device which measures a state of the one of the main shaft and the motor; a determination data obtaining unit which obtains determination data upon determining one of whether a fault has occurred in the one of the main shaft and the motor and a degree of fault; and a learning unit which learns the fault prediction of the one of the main shaft and the motor in accordance with a data set generated based on a combination of the state variable and the determination data. The data output from the motor controller may include a torque command value and a velocity command value for driving the motor, the detector may include at least one of a current detection unit which detects a current of the motor and a velocity detection unit which detects a velocity of the motor, and the measuring device may include at least one of a vibration measuring unit which measures vibration of the one of the main shaft and the motor, a sound measuring unit which measures a sound in vicinity of the one of the main shaft and the motor, and a temperature measuring unit which measures a temperature in the vicinity of the one of the main shaft and the motor. The main shaft may execute a predetermined operation pattern at an interval of not less than a predetermined time, and the state observation unit may observe the state variable in at least one of an accelerated state of the main shaft, a constant velocity-operated state of the main shaft, and one of a decelerated state of the main shaft and a coasted state o...",
