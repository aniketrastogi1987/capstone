  "abstract": "Embodiments of the invention relate to a globally asynchronous and locally synchronous neuromorphic network. One embodiment comprises generating a synchronization signal that is distributed to a plurality of neural core circuits. In response to the synchronization signal, in at least one core circuit, incoming spike events maintained by said at least one core circuit are processed to generate an outgoing spike event. Spike events are asynchronously communicated between the core circuits via a routing fabric comprising multiple asynchronous routers.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the invention relate to a globally asynchronous and locally synchronous neuromorphic network. One embodiment comprises generating a synchronization signal that is distributed to a plurality of neural core circuits. In response to the synchronization signal, in at least one core circuit, incoming spike events maintained by said at least one core circuit are processed to generate an outgoing spike event. Spike events are asynchronously communicated between the core circuits via a routing fabric comprising multiple asynchronous routers. Another embodiment comprises a neural network comprising a plurality of neural core circuits. Each core circuit comprises multiple digital neurons, multiple digital axons, and multiple digital synapses. Each synapse interconnects an axon with a neuron. The neural network further comprises a routing fabric comprising multiple asynchronous routers that interconnect the core circuits. The routing fabric facilitates asynchronous communication of spike events between the core circuits. A plurality of the core circuits process spike events synchronously in response to a synchronization signal. These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become understood with reference to the following description, appended claims and accompanying figures.",
