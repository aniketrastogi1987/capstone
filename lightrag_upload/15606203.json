  "abstract": "An approach for continuously provisioning machine learning models, executed by one or more computer nodes to provide a future prediction in response to a request from one or more client devices, is provided. The approach generates, by the one or more computer nodes, a machine learning model. The approach determines, by the one or more computer nodes, whether the machine learning model is a new model. In response to determining the machine learning model is not the new model, the approach retrieves, by the one or more computer nodes, one or more model containers with an associated model to a new persistent model. The approach determines, by the one or more computer nodes, a difference between the associated model and the new persistent model. Further, in response to determining the machine learning model is the new model, the approach generates, by the one or more computer nodes, one or more model containers.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In some exemplary embodiments, a continuous provisioning method, executed by one or more computer nodes to provide a future prediction in response to a request from one or more client devices, the continuous provisioning method includes: generating, by the one or more computer nodes, a machine learning model; determining, by the one or more computer nodes, whether the machine learning model is a new model; in response to determining the machine learning model is not the new model, retrieving, by the one or more computer nodes, one or more model containers with an associated model to a new persistent model; and determining, by the one or more computer nodes, a difference between the associated model and the new persistent model. In other exemplary embodiments, a continuous provisioning apparatus includes: a memory and at least one processor configured to execute: a model generator configured to generate a machine learning model; and a model container builder configured to: determine whether the machine learning model is a new model, in response to determining the machine learning model is not the new model, retrieve one or more model containers with an associated model to a new persistent model, and determine a difference between the associated model and the new persistent model. In yet other exemplary embodiments, a non-transitory computer readable recording medium including a program to execute a continuous provisioning method to provide a future prediction in response to a request from one or more client devices, the method including: generating, by one or more computer nodes, a machine learning model; determining, by the one or more computer nodes, whether the machine learning model is a new model; in response to determining the machine learning model is not the new model, retrieving, by the one or more computer nodes, one or more model containers with an associated model to a new persistent model; and determining, by the one or more computer n...",
