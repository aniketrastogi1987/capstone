  "abstract": "Techniques for training a deep neural network from user interaction workflow activities occurring among distributed computing devices are disclosed herein. In an example, processing of input data (such as input medical imaging data) is performed at a client computing device with the execution of an algorithm of a deep neural network. A set of updated training parameters are generated to update the algorithm of the deep neural network, based on user interaction activities (such as user acceptance and user modification in a graphical user interface) that occur with the results of the executed algorithm. The generation and collection of the updated training parameters at a server, received from a plurality of distributed client sites, can be used to refine, improve, and train the algorithm of the deep neural network for subsequent processing and execution.",
