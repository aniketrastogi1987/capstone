In one embodiment, in accordance with the present invention, the computer-implemented method includes generating, by one or more computer processors, a first piece of data based on a defined set of data characteristics. The method further includes generating, by one or more computer processors, a first bit, wherein the first bit corresponds to the first generated piece of data. The method further includes sending, by one or more computer processors, the first generated piece of data to a target location. The method further includes receiving, by one or more computer processors, the first generated piece of data from the target location. The method further includes determining, by one or more computer processors, whether to validate the first generated piece of data received from the target location. The method further includes adjusting, by one or more computer processors, the first generated bit based on the determination of whether to validate the first generated piece of data.",
