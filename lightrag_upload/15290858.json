  "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is introduced into an electronic meeting context to perform various tasks before, during, and/or after electronic meetings. The tasks may include a wide variety of tasks, such as agenda creation, participant selection, real-time meeting management, meeting content supplementation, and post-meeting processing. The artificial intelligence may analyze a wide variety of data such as data pertaining to other electronic meetings, data pertaining to organizations and users, and other general information pertaining to any topic. Capability is also provided to create, manage, and enforce meeting rules templates that specify requirements and constraints for various aspects of electronic meetings.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An apparatus includes one or more processors and one or more non-transitory computer-readable media storing instructions which, when processed by the one or more processors cause an electronic meeting process executing on the apparatus to generate and transmit, over one or more communications networks to an artificial intelligence service executing external to the apparatus, a request for suggested meeting participants for an electronic meeting. The request for suggested meeting participants for an electronic meeting specifies a plurality of attributes of the electronic meeting. The electronic meeting process executing on the apparatus receives, over the one or more communications networks from the artificial intelligence service executing external to the apparatus, a response to the request for suggested meeting participants for the electronic meeting. The response includes data that specifies a plurality of suggested meeting participants for the electronic meeting. The electronic meeting process displays, on a user interface, the plurality of suggested meeting participants and controls for specifying whether each suggested meeting participant, from the plurality of suggested meeting participants, is to be included in the electronic meeting. The electronic meeting process includes in the electronic meeting a particular suggested meeting participant, from the plurality of suggested meeting participants, in response to a user selection of a control that corresponds to including the particular suggested meeting participant in the electronic meeting. The approach may also be implemented by one or more non-transitory computer-readable media storing instructions which, when processed by one or more processors, causes the functionality to be performed. The approach may also be implemented by one or more computer-implemented methods.",
