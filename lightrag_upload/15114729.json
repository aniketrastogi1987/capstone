  "abstract": "A system identification device identifies a linear discrete-time system using a recursive method with respect to each dimension belonging to a designated search range of a system dimension, calculates a system output obtained when actual input data for identification is applied to a linear discrete-time system corresponding to each dimension as a system characteristic, determines a minimum dimension from among dimensions at which a norm distribution of sum of squares of errors in a time domain of the system output and actual output data for identification of the dynamic system is less than or equal to a threshold value, to be a system dimension n, and identifies a system matrix of the linear discrete-time system based on input and output vectors of the dynamic system, and a state vector generated using the determined system dimension.",
