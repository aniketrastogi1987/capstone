  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a method is provided for training state-classifiers for classification of cognitive state. A set of multimodal signals indicating physiological responses of an operator are sampled over a time period. A depiction of operation by the operator during the time period is displayed. In response to user input selecting a cognitive state for a portion of the time period, the one or more state-classifiers are trained to map the set of multimodal signals to a set of cognitive states. In training the state-classifiers, the set of multimodal signals sampled in the portion of the time period are used as input to the one or more state-classifiers and the selected one of the set of cognitive states is used as a target result to be indicated by the one or more state-classifiers. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a system is provided. The system includes a set of sensors configured to provide a set of multimodal signals indicating physiological responses of an operator to the stimuli (e.g., visual, auditory, and/or tactile) in a first time period. A processing circuit is configured to train one or more state-classifiers to map the set of multimodal signals to a set of cognitive states. The system also includes a display configured to depict operation by the operator in the first time period. The processing circuit is further configured to, in response to user input selecting one of the set of cognitive states and a portion of the first time period, perform the training of the one or more state-classifiers using the set of multimodal signals sampled in the portion of the time period as input to the one or more state-classifiers and the selected one of the set of cognitive states as a target result to be mapped to by the one or more state-classifiers. These and other features, advantages, and objects of the present invention will be further understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art by referenc...",
