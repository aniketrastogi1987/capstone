  "abstract": "An integrated circuit designing system includes a non-transitory storage medium that is encoded with first and second sets of standard cell layouts that are configured for performing a selected function and which correspond to a specific manufacturing process. The manufacturing process is characterized by a nominal minimum pitch (T) for metal lines with each of the standard cell layouts being characterized by a cell height (H) that is a non-integral multiple of the nominal minimum pitch. The system also includes a hardware processor coupled to the storage medium for executing a set of instructions for generating an integrated circuit layout utilizing a combination of the first and second set of standard cell layouts and the nominal minimum pitch. The first and second sets of standard layouts are related in that each of the second set of standard cell layouts corresponds to a transformed version of a corresponding standard cell layout from the first set of standard cell layouts.",
