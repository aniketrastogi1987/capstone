  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Various approaches are described herein for, among other things, performing intent-based scheduling via a digital personal assistant. For instance, an intent of user(s) to perform an action (a.k.a. activity) may be used to schedule time (e.g., on a calendar of at least one of the user(s)) in which the action is to be performed. Examples of performing an action include but are not limited to having a meeting, working on a project, participating in a social event, exercising, and reading. In a first example approach, communication(s) from a first user are analyzed (e.g., programmatically analyzed or processed) to identify a first communication from the first user that indicates that the first user has an intent to have a first meeting between at least the first user and second user(s). Communication(s) from the second user(s) are analyzed to identify second communication(s) from the second user(s) that are in response to the first communication and that indicate that the second user(s) have the intent to have the first meeting. A digital personal assistant is caused (e.g., programmatically configured) to automatically propose and/or automatically schedule a time to have the first meeting between at least the first user and the second user(s) based at least in part on the first communication and the second communication(s) indicating that the first user and the second user(s) have the intent to have the first meeting. In a second example approach, interactions among users are identified. Tools that are used to facilitate the interactions are identified. An intent to have a meeting between the users is inferred. A designated tool is automatically selected to establish communication for the meeting based at least in part on the designated tool being used more than other tools to facilitate the interactions. A digital personal assistant is caused to automatically schedule the meeting and/or automatically propose to schedule the meeting based at least in...",
