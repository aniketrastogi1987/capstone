  "abstract": "A radiation imaging apparatus acquires a radiation image from radiation detected by a radiation detection unit, corrects a first pixel that is a correction target in the radiation image by referring to a second pixel other than the first pixel, calculates an evaluation value that evaluates an increase in a noise level caused by correcting the first pixel, and performs processing of reducing the noise level for the first pixel after the correction based on the calculated evaluation value.",
