  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>An example of an object of the present invention is to provide an explicit knowledge conversion assistance apparatus, an explicit knowledge conversion assistance method, and a computer-readable storage medium, according to which the above-described problems can be solved and priority ranks can be set for agricultural tasks when know-how relating to agricultural tasks is to be converted into explicit knowledge. In order to achieve the above-described object, an explicit knowledge conversion assistance apparatus according to an aspect of the present invention includes: a table acquisition unit configured to acquire a table in which, for each agricultural task for a specific crop, an influence degree indicating influence that the agricultural task has on an outcome, a type of skill required for the agricultural task, and a level of a worker required for the agricultural task are defined by numerical values; an evaluation value calculation unit configured to, for each agricultural task, calculate an evaluation value based on the values for the influence degree, the type of skill, and the level, using the table; and a priority rank setting unit configured to set a priority rank for each agricultural task based on the calculated evaluation value. Also, in order to achieve the above-described object, an explicit knowledge conversion assistance method according to an aspect of the present invention includes: (a) a step of acquiring a table in which, for each agricultural task for a specific crop, an influence degree indicating influence that the agricultural task has on an outcome, a type of skill required for the agricultural task, and a level of a worker required for the agricultural task are defined by numerical values; (b) a step of, for each agricultural task, calculating an evaluation value based on the values for the influence degree, the type of skill, and the level, using the table; and (c) a step of setting a priority rank for e...",
