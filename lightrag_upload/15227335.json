Accordingly, an aspect of the present disclosure is to provide an electronic device for efficiently developing and managing a function of storing security information by managing functions associated with storing the security information in an integrated way and a method for storing the security information thereof. Accordingly, another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide an electronic for managing security information in a fluid way based on its situation and a method for storing the security information thereof. In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, an electronic device is provided. The electronic device may include at least one memory configured to include a first secured region and a second secured region different from the first secured region and a processor configured to electronically connect with the at least one memory. The at least one memory may store instructions, when executed, for instructing the processor to execute an application program configured to store data in the first secured region, to receive an input for storing the data, through the application program, and to store the data in the second secured region rather than the first secured region in response the input. In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, an electronic device is provided. The electronic device may include at least one memory configured to include a secured region to store security information and a processor configured to electrically connect with the at least one memory. The processor may be configured to execute an application program configured to store the security information in a first secured region, to receive a request to store the security information from the application program, and to store the security information in a second secured...",
