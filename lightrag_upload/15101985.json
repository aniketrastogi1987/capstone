An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for updating an application program, which may be applied to a terminal and may include that: a distance between the terminal and another terminal with a short-distance wireless communication function is acquired; when the distance is shorter than or equal to a preset data transmission distance, first version information of the terminal and second version information of the other terminal are acquired; when a version type in the first version information of the terminal is the same as a version type in the second version information of the other terminal, a version level in the first version information is compared with a version level in the second version information; and when the version level in the first version information is different from the version level in the second version information, updating is performed according to a high-level version file. Another embodiment of the present disclosure provides a terminal, which may include: a first acquisition component, a second acquisition component, a comparison component and an updating component, wherein the first acquisition component may be configured to acquire a distance between the terminal and another terminal with a short-distance wireless communication function is acquired; the second acquisition component may be configured to, when the distance is shorter than or equal to a preset data transmission distance, acquire first version information of the terminal and second version information of the other terminal; the comparison component may be configured to, when a version type in the first version information of the terminal is the same as a version type in the second version information of the other terminal, compare a version level in the first version in...",
