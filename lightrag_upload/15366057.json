  "abstract": "A processor comprises a neural network unit (NNU) and a processing complex (PC) comprising a processing core and cache memory. The NNU comprises neural processing units (NPU), cache control logic (CCL) and a memory array (MA). To transition from a first mode in which the MA operates to hold neural network weights for the array of NPUs to a second mode in which the MA and CCL operate as a victim cache, the CCL begins to cache evicted cache lines into the MA in response to eviction requests and begins to provide to the PC lines that hit in the MA in response to load requests. To transition from the second mode to the first mode, the CCL invalidates all lines of the MA, ceases to cache evicted lines into the MA in response to eviction requests, and ceases to provide to the PC lines in response to load requests.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a processor that includes a neural network unit (NNU). FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a NPU of FIG. 1 . FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the arrangement of the N mux-regs of the N NPUs of the NNU of FIG. 1 to illustrate their operation as an N-word rotater, or circular shifter, for a row of data words received from the data RAM of FIG. 1 . FIG. 4 is a table illustrating a program for storage in the program memory of and execution by the NNU of FIG. 1 . FIG. 5 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 4 by the NNU. FIG. 6A is a block diagram illustrating the NNU of FIG. 1 to execute the program of FIG. 4 . FIG. 6B is a flowchart illustrating operation of the processor of FIG. 1 to perform an architectural program that uses the NNU to perform multiply-accumulate-activation function computations classically associated with neurons of hidden layers of an artificial neural network such as performed by the program of FIG. 4 . FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating a NPU of FIG. 1 according to an alternate embodiment. FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a NPU of FIG. 1 according to an alternate embodiment. FIG. 9 is a table illustrating a program for storage in the program memory of and execution by the NNU of FIG. 1 . FIG. 10 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 9 by the NNU. FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the NNU of FIG. 1 is shown. In the embodiment of FIG. 11 , a neuron is split into two portions, the activation function unit portion and the ALU portion (which also includes the shift register portion), and each activation function unit portion is shared by multiple ALU portions. FIG. 12 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 4 by the NNU of FIG. 11 . FIG. 13 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 4 by the N...",
