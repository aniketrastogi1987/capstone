  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Techniques for implementing binary neural networks on programmable integrated circuits (ICs) are described. In an example, a circuit of a neural network implemented in an integrated circuit (IC) includes a layer of hardware neurons, the layer including a plurality of inputs, a plurality of outputs, a plurality of weights, and a plurality of threshold values, each of the hardware neurons including: a logic circuit having inputs that receive first logic signals from at least a portion of the plurality of inputs and outputs that supply second logic signals corresponding to an exclusive NOR (XNOR) of the first logic signals and at least a portion of the plurality of weights; a counter circuit having inputs that receive the second logic signals and an output that supplies a count signal indicative of the number of the second logic signals having a predefined logic state; and a compare circuit having an input that receives the count signal and an output that supplies a logic signal having a logic state indicative of a comparison between the count signal and a threshold value of the plurality of threshold values; wherein the logic signal output by the compare circuit of each of the hardware neurons is provided as a respective one of the plurality of outputs. In another example, a method of implementing a neural network in an integrated circuit (IC) includes implementing a layer of hardware neurons in the IC, the layer including a plurality of inputs, a plurality of outputs, a plurality of weights, and a plurality of threshold values; and at each of the plurality of neurons: receiving first logic signals from at least a portion of the plurality of inputs and supplying second logic signals corresponding to an exclusive NOR (XNOR) of the first logic signals and at least a portion of the plurality of weights; receiving the second logic signals and supplying a count signal indicative of the number of the second logic signals having a predefined logic state; a...",
