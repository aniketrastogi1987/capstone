  "abstract": "According to one embodiment, in response to a search query received from a client device for searching content, one or more first keywords are determined from the search query. A lookup operation is performed in an image-to-keyword (image/keyword) mapping table based on the first keywords. The image/keyword mapping table includes a plurality of entries, each entry mapping an image identifier (ID) identifying an image to one or more second keywords. For each of images identified in the image/keyword mapping table, a matching degree is determined between the first keywords and the second keywords. A ranking process is performed based on matching degrees on a plurality of images identified in the image/keyword mapping table whose second keywords match at least a portion of the first keywords.",
