  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE <EOH>According to certain embodiments, a computer-implemented method is disclosed for dynamic mobile printing based on scheduled events, the method comprising: receiving, from a device associated with a user, an identifier associated with the user and a print request, the print request including one or more print items to be printed; accessing, by a server, a calendar of the user based on the received identifier associated with the user; determining, by the server, whether an event of the calendar is scheduled for a time of interest; locating, by the server, a printer near a location of the event when the event is scheduled for the time of interest; and transmitting, by the server, the one or more print items to the printer near the location of the event. According to certain embodiments, a system is disclosed for dynamic mobile printing based on scheduled events, the system comprising: a memory storage device storing instructions for dynamic mobile printing based on scheduled events; and one or more processors configured to execute the instructions to perform a method including: receiving, from a device associated with a user, an identifier associated with the user and a print request, the print request including one or more print items to be printed; accessing, by a server, a calendar of the user based on the received identifier associated with the user; determining, by the server, whether an event of the calendar is scheduled for a time of interest; locating, by the server, a printer near a location of the event when the event is scheduled for the time of interest; and transmitting, by the server, the one or more print items to the printer near the location of the event. According to one embodiment, a computer-readable medium is disclosed that stores instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to execute a method dynamic mobile printing based on scheduled events, the method comprising: receiving, from a dev...",
