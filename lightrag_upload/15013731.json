  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Aspects of an embodiment of the present invention disclose a method, a computer system, and a computer program product for cycle-reproducible debug processes in a multi-core environment, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The method includes executing, by one or more computer processors, an exerciser image on one or more cores, wherein the exerciser image includes one or more different seeds. The method includes determining, by one or more computer processors, a seed from the one or more different seeds that locates a fail-condition. Responsive to determining a seed from the one or more different seeds that locates the fail condition, the method includes determining, by one or more computer processors, an upper bound and a lower bound of the fail-condition. The method includes determining, by one or more computer processors, an exact cycle where the fail-condition occurs. The method includes constructing, by one or more computer processors, a multi-cycle trace for the fail-condition.",
