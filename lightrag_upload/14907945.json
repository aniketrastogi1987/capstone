  "abstract": "Mechanisms are provided for energy management signalling with an apparatus for processing data, such as a system-on-chip integrated circuit (2). Processing circuitry (6, 8, 10) is coupled to consumer energy interface circuitry (14, 16, 18) which communicates with energy management circuitry (4). The energy management signals which are communicated include a static power consumption signal indicative of a level of power consumption which is independent of processing operations being performed and a dynamic power consumption signal indicative of a level of dynamic power consumption which is dependent upon the processing operations being performed.",
