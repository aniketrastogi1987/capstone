  "abstract": "To generate insights in a predictive analysis framework for support management, raw data is received as input from an in-memory database. A predictive analysis library is integrated in the predictive analysis framework. The predictive analysis framework is generated as a configurable application-programming interface (API). Predictive analysis is performed based on the raw data and the configurable data points. The predictive analysis library functions are invoked from the in-memory database to perform predictive analysis. Predictive data model is generated based on computation performed using a prediction algorithm. Predictive insights are generated based on the predictive data model. The predictive insights are displayed in a user interface associated with a device.",
