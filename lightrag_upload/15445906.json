  "abstract": "An electronic neuron device that includes a thresholding unit which utilizes current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT). A two-step switching scheme is implemented with the device. In the first step, a charge current through heavy metal (HM) places the magnetization of a nano-magnet along the hard-axis (i.e. an unstable point for the magnet). In the second step, the device receives a current (from an electronic synapse) which moves the magnetization from the unstable point to one of the two stable states. The polarity of the net synaptic current determines the final orientation of the magnetization. A resistive crossbar array may also be provided which functions as the synapse generating a bipolar current that is a weighted sum of the inputs of the device.",
