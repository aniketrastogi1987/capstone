  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>According to an aspect of the present invention, an image processing apparatus includes an image forming unit configured to form an image, a measuring unit configured to measure an image formed by the image forming unit, a control unit configured to control execution of a single-color calibration to be performed to correct reproduction characteristics of a single-color formed by the image forming unit based on a measuring result obtained in a case where the measuring unit measures a single-color image formed with a single-color recording agent by the image forming unit, and execution of a multi-color calibration to be performed to correct reproduction characteristics of a multi-color formed by the image forming unit based on a measuring result obtained in a case where the measuring unit measures a multi-color image formed with a plurality of recording agents by the image forming unit, and a selection unit configured to select whether to cause the control unit to perform the multi-color calibration after completing the single-color calibration or cause the control unit to perform any one of the single-color calibration and the multi-color calibration. According to the present invention, an image processing apparatus capable of selectively performing a single-color calibration or a multi-color calibration can prevent the correction accuracy in the calibration from deteriorating which is caused by that only one of two calibrations is chiefly performed (too often). Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.",
