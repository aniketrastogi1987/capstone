  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Systems and methods are disclosed for operating a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) by determining a corrected energy function of high-order semi-RBMs (hs-RBMs) without self-interaction; performing distributed pre-training of the hs-RBM; adjusting weights of the hs-RBM using contrastive divergence; generating predictions by Gibbs Sampling or by determining conditional probabilities with hidden units integrated out; and generating predictions. Advantages of the system may include one or more of the following. The system is capable of modeling both the mean and high-order interactions between binary input features in the hs-RBM framework for the first time. The system can handle arbitrarily higher-order (3-order or more) interactions between features for discrete data matrix completion and collaborative filtering. The system can make predictions incorporating complicated high-order feature interactions in a probabilistic framework. The system can perform distributed optimization to deal with large-scale datasets with many features. The system can model arbitrarily higher-order (3-order or more) feature interactions between continuous data with a novel bounded energy function for data de-noising, completion, and classification.",
