  "abstract": "A system and method for stent recommendation are disclosed herein. The stent recommendation system includes a processor and a database. The processor acquires an image of the body part of a subject where a stent is to be implanted, simulates a stent implantation target location for each of a plurality of types of stents based on the image, and computes a fitness score for each of the plurality of types of stents based on preset evaluation criteria. The processor displays at least one of the plurality of types of stents on a display screen as recommended stents based on the fitness score computed for each of the plurality of types of stents. The database stores the result data of the simulation performed for each of the plurality of types of stents.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE <EOH>At least one embodiment of the present invention is intended to recommend an appropriate stent to be implanted in the body of a subject via virtual simulation. At least one embodiment of the present invention is intended to provide criteria for the determination of which of the numerous conventional types of stents is most appropriate to the body portion of a subject where a stent is to be implanted. At least one embodiment of the present invention is intended to provide information about the recommendation of a stent most appropriate to a subject in an intuitively understandable form. At least one embodiment of the present invention is intended to display the results of the simulation of the implantation of stents, which is virtually performed, on a display screen in an easily viewable form. According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a stent recommendation system, including a processor and a database. The processor includes an image acquisition unit, a computation unit, and a display control unit. The image acquisition unit is configured to acquire an image of the body part of a subject where a stent is to be implanted; the computation unit is configured to simulate a stent implantation target location for each of a plurality of types of stents based on the image, and to compute a fitness score for each of the plurality of types of stents based on preset evaluation criteria; the display control unit is configured to display at least one of the plurality of types of stents on a display screen as at least one of recommended stent based on the fitness score computed for each of the plurality of types of stents; and the database is configured to store the result data of the simulation performed for each of the plurality of types of stents based on the image. The stent recommendation system may further include a first interface control unit configured to provide a user input menu that enables a weight to be ad...",
