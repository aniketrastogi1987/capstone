  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>An objective of the present invention is to provide a touch panel wire arrangement circuit, and the touch panel wire arrangement circuit diminishes the resistance, and raises the uniformity of the resistance to make the display panel utilizing the touch panel wire arrangement circuit reduce the flicker or mura. First, a touch panel wire arrangement circuit is provided, the touch panel wire arrangement circuit comprises: an ITO region, metal wires, a touch control hole and an integrated circuit in common Indium Tin Oxide com ITO; wherein the touch panel wire arrangement circuit further comprises: a rear end switch set, and the rear end switch set comprises: a plurality of switches, and a G electrode of each switch in the plurality of switches is inputted with a switch signal, and D electrodes of the plurality of switches are sequentially coupled to rear ends of the metal wires, and S electrodes of the plurality of switches are inputted with at least one voltage signals; the switch signal is: a signal at high voltage level as a touch panel TP signal does not function; the voltage signal is a common voltage V-com signal as the touch panel is in a display state. Combining the touch panel wire arrangement circuit provided by first, in the first selective solution of one, the rear end switch set comprises: a plurality of rear end switch sub sets divided in order, and the rear end switch sub set comprises: n switches, and S electrodes of the n switches are respectively inputted with n voltage signals through n metal wires, and the n voltage signals are: voltage signals of n various voltage signal values as the touch panel is in a front section detection; the n is a natural number larger than or equal to 2. Combining the first selective solution of first, in the second selective solution of first, the touch panel wire arrangement circuit further comprises a front end switch set, and the front end switch set comprises: a plurality of front...",
