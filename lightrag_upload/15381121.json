  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>It is an object of the present invention to provide a fixing frame for a heat sink, whereby the heat sink can be mounted to a circuit board of various sizes to dissipate heat therefrom, thereby enhancing convenience in use. Accordingly, the present invention provides a fixing frame for a heat sink, the heat sink being mounted to the fixing frame to dissipate heat from electronic components. The fixing frame includes a plurality of boards, at least one foldable plate and a plurality of connection members. The boards surround a hollow area; the hollow area includes a main accommodating space and at least one subsidiary accommodating space at one side of the main accommodating space. The at least one foldable plate is detachably connected to one of the boards and is disposed in the at least one subsidiary accommodating space. The connection members are disposed on the boards, and the fixing frame is assembled to the heat sink by means of the connection members. Compared with the conventional techniques, the hollow area of the fixing frame includes a main accommodating space and at least one subsidiary accommodating space. The at least one subsidiary accommodating space is disposed at one side of the main accommodating space and is in communication with the main accommodating space. Furthermore, the foldable plate is detachably connected (by means of a connection rib) to the board of the fixing frame and is disposed in the subsidiary accommodating space. Accordingly, when a length of the circuit board does not exceed the main accommodating space, the circuit board does not exert an external force to the foldable plate, and the foldable plate is still in the subsidiary accommodating space to support the circuit board. On the other hand, the foldable plate can be removed to expose the subsidiary accommodating space by breaking the connection rib with an adequate external force. Accordingly, the fixing frame can be assembled to a circuit board of a diffe...",
