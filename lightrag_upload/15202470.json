  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Various embodiments of the present disclosure can include systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media configured to train a machine learning model to forecast growth of a content item, the growth being measured based at least in part on a count of user interactions with the content item, wherein the model is trained to adjust growth forecasts for the content item in response to one or more users interacting with the content item. A first growth forecast for the content item can be determined for a unit of time using the machine learning model. A determination is made that a first user has interacted with the content item. A second growth forecast for the content item can be determined for the unit of time using the machine learning model and based at least in part on the first user interacting with the content item. In an embodiment, the content item corresponds to at least one of a page, post, media item, or link that is published through the computing system. In an embodiment, the user interaction corresponds to at least one of a selection of a like option, a selection of a check-in option, posting content, or sharing content. In an embodiment, the machine learning model is trained using user interactions that are measured for a group of users of a particular demographic, and wherein the machine learning model predicts growth of the content item based on interactions from users in the particular demographic. In an embodiment, the systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media are configured to generate a set of training examples that each correspond to a unit of time and include an outcome, a position value determined for the unit of time, a velocity value determined for the unit of time, an acceleration value determined for the unit of time, and respective values indicating which users interacted with the content item during the unit of time. In an embodiment, the systems, methods, and non-transitory computer read...",
