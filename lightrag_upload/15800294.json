  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to reducing the complexity of convolutions in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In one aspect, a method for convolution in a convolutional neural network (CNN) is provided that includes accessing a coefficient value of a filter corresponding to an input feature map of a convolution layer of the CNN, and performing a block multiply accumulation operation on a block of data elements of the input feature map, the block of data elements corresponding to the coefficient value, wherein, for each data element of the block of data elements, a value of the data element is multiplied by the coefficient value and a result of the multiply is added to a corresponding data element in a corresponding output block of data elements comprised in an output feature map. In one aspect, an apparatus is provided that includes a processor, and a memory storing software instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause convolution of an input feature map of a convolution layer of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to be performed wherein a coefficient value of a filter corresponding to the input feature map is accessed, and a block multiply accumulation operation is performed on a block of data elements of the input feature map, the block of data elements corresponding to the coefficient value, wherein, for each data element of the block of data elements, a value of the data element is multiplied by the coefficient value and a result of the multiply is added to a corresponding data element in a corresponding output block of data elements comprised in an output feature map. In one aspect, a method for convolution of an input feature map of a convolution layer in a convolutional neural network (CNN) that includes accessing a nonzero coefficient value of a filter corresponding to the input feature map from a first plurality of nonzero coefficients of the filter, accessing a pointer to a block of data elements of the i...",
