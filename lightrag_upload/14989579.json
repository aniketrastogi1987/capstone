  "abstract": "An event-driven neural network includes a plurality of interconnected core circuits is provided. Each core circuit includes an electronic synapse array has multiple digital synapses interconnecting a plurality of digital electronic neurons. A synapse interconnects an axon of a pre-synaptic neuron with a dendrite of a post-synaptic neuron. A neuron integrates input spikes and generates a spike event in response to the integrated input spikes exceeding a threshold. Each core circuit also has a scheduler that receives a spike event and delivers the spike event to a selected axon in the synapse array based on a schedule for deterministic event delivery.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the invention provide event-driven neural architecture for neural networks. According to an embodiment of the invention, a neural network comprises a plurality of interconnected core circuits. Each core circuit comprises an electronic synapse array comprising multiple digital synapses interconnecting a plurality of digital electronic neurons, a synapse interconnecting an axon of a pre-synaptic neuron with a dendrite of a post-synaptic neuron, wherein a neuron integrates input spikes and generates a spike event in response to the integrated input spikes exceeding a threshold. The core circuit further comprises a scheduler that receives a spike event and delivers the spike event to a selected axon in the synapse array based on a schedule for deterministic event delivery. These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become understood with reference to the following description, appended claims and accompanying figures.",
