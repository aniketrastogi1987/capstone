  "abstract": "A Remote Test Separation (RTS) system comprising an original software product instrumented for testing and a shared memory accessible to the original software product, the shared memory including a plurality of coverage counters. The RTS system further comprising an agent, capable of accessing the shared memory, the agent to read the plurality of coverage counters, the agent to read the plurality of coverage counters at an end of a test, and write coverage data to another memory. The RTS system runs a plurality of tests without interruption, and generates coverage data associated with a plurality of sequential tests and records the associations between lines of code and an associated test.",
