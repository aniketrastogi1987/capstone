  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>It is to be understood that both the following general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive. In an aspect, a method is disclosed comprising generating, by an electronic vapor device, usage data related to the electronic vapor device, transmitting, by the electronic vapor device, the usage data to a central server, receiving, by the electronic vapor device, an indication that a transfer of a good to a user of the electronic vapor device has initiated based on the usage data and a user preference, and displaying the indication. In another aspect, a method is disclosed comprising receiving, by a central server, usage data related to an electronic vapor device, determining, by the central server, a good based on the usage data and a user preference, initiating, by the central server, a transfer of the good to a user of the electronic vapor device, generating, by the central server, an indication that the transfer of the good to the user of the electronic vapor device has initiated, and transmitting, by the central server, the indication to the electronic vapor device. Additional advantages will be set forth in part in the description which follows or can be learned by practice. The advantages will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive.",
