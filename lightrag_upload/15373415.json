  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Various embodiments of the present disclosure can include systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media configured to obtain a conversation of a user in a chat application associated with a system, where the conversation includes one or more utterances by the user. An analysis of the one or more utterances by the user can be performed. A sentiment associated with the conversation can be determined based on a machine learning model, wherein the machine learning model is trained based on a plurality of features including demographic information associated with users. In some embodiments, the system is a social networking system, and the conversation is between the user and an agent associated with a page of an entity in the social networking system. In certain embodiments, the machine learning model can be trained based on the plurality of features, wherein the plurality of features further include one or more of: attributes associated with conversations, attributes associated with post history of users, or attributes associated with page history of users. In an embodiment, the machine learning model provides one or more of: a sentiment score associated with the conversation or a sentiment label associated with the conversation. In some embodiments, the sentiment label is indicative of a rating on a rating scale. In certain embodiments, the sentiment associated with the conversation is determined in or near real time. In an embodiment, the performing the analysis of the one or more utterances by the user includes performing a textual analysis of an utterance by the user. In some embodiments, the performing the analysis of the one or more utterances by the user includes determining a sentiment associated with one or more of: an emoticon, an emoji, or an indicator relating to text style. In certain embodiments, the sentiment associated with the conversation is determined based at least in part on the analysis of the one or more utteranc...",
