  "abstract": "Disclosed in some examples are systems, methods, and machine readable mediums which allow for the automatic creation of a skills hierarchy. The skills hierarchy comprises an organization of a standardized list of skills into a hierarchy that describes category relationships between the skills in the hierarchy. The category relationships may include no relationships, parent relationships, and child relationships. A skill may be considered a parent of another skill if the parent skill describes a broader category of skill that includes the child. Other relationships such as grandparent (e.g., a parent's parent), great-grandparent, grandchild, great grandchild and so on may be defined inferentially as well. In some examples, the constructed hierarchy may be organized with broader skills at higher levels and narrower skills at lower levels.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>In the drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, like numerals may describe similar components in different views. Like numerals having different letter suffixes may represent different instances of similar components. The drawings illustrate generally, by way of example, but not by way of limitation, various embodiments discussed in the present document. FIG. 1 is a flowchart of a method of constructing a skills hierarchy according to some examples of the present disclosure. FIG. 2 is a flowchart of a method of training a skills classifier according to some examples of the present disclosure. FIG. 3 is a portion of a skills hierarchy according to some examples of the present disclosure. FIG. 4 is a schematic of a social networking system according to some examples of the present disclosure. FIG. 5 is a schematic of a machine according to some examples of the present disclosure. detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?",
