  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one example, a method includes generating reference image data representing a field of view of an interior of a fuel tank, and generating active image data representing the field of view of the interior of the fuel tank when the fuel tank contains fuel. The method can further include producing, by a processing device, a fuel measurement value representing an amount of fuel contained in the fuel tank based on the reference image data and the active image data, and outputting, by the processing device, an indication of the fuel measurement value. In another example, a system can include one or more image capturing devices, at least one processor, and computer-readable memory. The one or more image capturing devices can be located to generate reference image data representative of an interior of a fuel tank, and generate active image data of the interior of the fuel tank when the fuel tank contains fuel. The computer-readable memory can be encoded with instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to produce a fuel measurement value representing an amount of fuel contained in the fuel tank based on the reference image data and the active image data, and output an indication of the fuel measurement value.",
