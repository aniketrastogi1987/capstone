  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The invention has been developed in response to the present state of the art and, in particular, in response to the problems and needs in the art that have not yet been fully solved by currently available systems and methods. Accordingly, the invention has been developed to provide systems and methods to accelerate recovery in data replication environments. The features and advantages of the invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter. Consistent with the foregoing, a method for accelerating recovery in a data replication environment is disclosed herein. In one embodiment, such a method includes maintaining a secondary out-of-sync bitmap for a secondary volume. The secondary out-of-sync bitmap indicates which storage elements on the secondary volume are not synchronized with storage elements on a primary volume. The method further generates, for the primary volume, a tracking bitmap indicating which storage elements on the primary volume need to be updated with data from the secondary volume. This tracking bitmap is initialized with values from the secondary out-of-sync bitmap. Upon receiving a write from the secondary volume to a storage element on the primary volume, the method resets the corresponding bit in the tracking bitmap. Upon receiving a write from a host system to a storage element on the primary volume, the method also resets the corresponding bit in the tracking bitmap. A corresponding system and computer program product are also disclosed and claimed herein.",
