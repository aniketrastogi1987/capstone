  "abstract": "A method for touch classification includes obtaining frame data representative of a plurality of frames captured by a touch-sensitive device, analyzing the frame data to define a respective blob in each frame of the plurality of frames, the blobs being indicative of a touch event, computing a plurality of feature sets for the touch event, each feature set specifying properties of the respective blob in each frame of the plurality of frames, and determining a type of the touch event via machine learning classification configured to provide multiple non-bimodal classification scores based on the plurality of feature sets for the plurality of frames, each non-bimodal classification score being indicative of an ambiguity level in the machine learning classification.",
