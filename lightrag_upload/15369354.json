  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Implementations of the present disclosure include computer-implemented methods for data analytics. In some implementations, actions include providing a first insight provider as one or more computer-executable programs, the first insight provider including a first logic component and a first configuration component, the first logic component including a first domain-specific model, the first configuration component including one or more parameter values for processing data using the first domain-specific model, receiving a first set of assets comprising data indicative of one or more assets, retrieving asset data associated with at least one asset of the first set of assets, the asset data including operational technology (OT) data and information technology (IT) data, the OT data being provided from one or more networked devices, the IT data being provided from one or more enterprise systems, and processing the OT data and the IT data using the first domain-specific model of the first logic component to provide a first result set, the first result set including one or more of a second set of assets and enriched data. Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices. These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features: actions further include providing the first result set as input to a second insight provider, the second insight provider providing a second result set at least partially based on the first result set; the first insight provider and the second insight provider are included in an insight provider pipeline; the first insight provider executes in a data enrichment mode, and the first result set includes the enriched data; the first insight provider executes in a filter mode, and the first result set includes the second set of assets; the data indicative ...",
