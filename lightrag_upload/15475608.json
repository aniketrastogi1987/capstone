  "abstract": "Systems methods and media for preference clustering are provided. In one example, a clustering system for analyzing a cluster comprises processors and a memory storing instructions that cause the system to calculate a Distance Angular Measure (DAM) for the cluster, the (DAM) comprising a distance component and an angular component of the cluster. In one example, the distance component of the (DAM) includes one of a cluster variation and a cluster radius.",
