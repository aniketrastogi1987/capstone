  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>An exemplary object of the present invention is to provide a success support system, information processing device, success support method, and success support program that can realize a more effective matching service. An information processing device according to the present invention includes: a relation information storage unit which stores information indicating relations, each being a relation between a success rate of accomplishing an aimed purpose by a pair of persons or things and attributes of each of the persons or things; and a proposal unit which proposes to change at least some of attributes of at least one of persons or things composing a new pair, based on the information stored in the relation information storage unit. A success support system according to the present invention includes: a learning unit which machine-learns relations, each being a relation between a success rate of accomplishing an aimed purpose by any pair of persons or things and attributes of each of the persons or things, using, as learning data, a set of attributes of persons or things of each pair for which a success or failure of the purpose is determinable; a simulation unit which, upon receiving designation of a pair of specific persons or things, analyzes changed the success rates while changing at least some of attributes of at least one of the persons or things of the designated pair, using a result of the learning by the learning unit; a display unit which displays at least: a result of analysis by the simulation unit; and/or modified attribute or attributes among the set of attributes or a contribution of the change to improvement of the success rate identified by the result, which improves the success rate of the designated pair. A success support method according to the present invention includes proposing, by an information processing device, based on information that is stored in a predetermined storage unit and indicates relatio...",
