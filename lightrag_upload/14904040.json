The coupling devices are individually controlled to simulate a computational problem. In another aspect, a computational machine includes a number N1 of parametric oscillators and a number N2 of coupling devices, each of which controllably couples a plurality of the number N1 of parametric oscillators together. The coupling devices are individually controlled to simulate a computational problem.",
