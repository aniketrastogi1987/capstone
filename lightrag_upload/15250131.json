  "abstract": "A learning device includes a classification unit that classifies data to be determined by using a learner configured to classify data based on a predetermined feature among features included in the data. The learning device includes an estimation unit that estimates, from classification results according to the classification unit, the behavior of the probability of a mistake occurring in the classification results according to the classification unit based on a large deviation principle. The learning device includes a determination unit that determines, based on the behavior estimated by the estimation unit, whether to add a new feature to an object to be learned for the learner.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>It is an object of the present invention to at least partially solve the problems in the conventional technology. According to one aspect of an embodiment a learning device includes a classification unit that classifies data to be determined by using a learner configured to classify data based on a predetermined feature among features included in the data. The learning device includes an estimation unit that estimates, from classification results according to the classification unit, the behavior of the probability of a mistake occurring in the classification results according to the classification unit based on a large deviation principle. The learning device includes a determination unit that determines, based on the behavior estimated by the estimation unit, whether to add a new feature to an object to be learned for the learner. The above and other objects, features, advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.",
