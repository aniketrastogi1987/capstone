  "abstract": "A device, system, and method use predictive analytics based on an application-centric approach. The method includes receiving a request from an interactive application interacting with a user utilizing a user device for action data indicating an action to be taken by the interactive application during a session with the user device, the request generated by the interactive application based on a decision point associated with the interactive application. The method includes receiving from the interactive application session data associated with the session and the user device. The method includes determining scoring package data associated with the request based on the session data, the scoring package data comprising a predictive model indicative of a plurality of actions to be performed by the interactive application. The method includes generating the action data based on the scoring package data and transmitting the action data to the interactive application.",
