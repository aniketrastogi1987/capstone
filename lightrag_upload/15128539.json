  "abstract": "In this invention, a property of a prediction target or analysis target can be predicted or analyzed with a high degree of precision during a transition from a stage in which there is extremely little or no known data about said prediction target or analysis target to a stage in which a sufficient amount of known data has been accumulated. This learning-model selection system comprises a model-evaluating means for evaluating learning models and a model-selecting means for selecting either a target learning model or a higher-order learning model on the basis of the result of the evaluation.",
