  "abstract": "A building block (1) for a quantum information processing system includes a superconducting qubit (2) having a Josephson junction (5) connected between two superconducting electrodes (3, 4). The two superconducting electrodes (3, 4) are coaxial and coplanar. The building block (1) also includes a control line (6) coupled to the superconducting qubit (2) and arranged to control the state of the superconducting qubit (2), and/or a readout element (8) coupled to the superconducting qubit (2) and arranged to measure the state of the superconducting qubit (2). The control line (6) and/or the readout element (8) are arranged out of plane with respect to the two superconducting electrodes (3, 4).",
