  "abstract": "A machine learning based procurement system comprises a machine learning classifier to classify bids. The procurement system determines a price risk score and a supplier risk score for each of the bids based on the classifications, and determines if any of the bids are associated with a high-risk procurement based on comparing the price risk score and the supplier risk score to the respective threshold. The procurement system includes a graphical user interface that can display bid evaluation links, which are accessible to provide information explaining high-risk procurements.",
