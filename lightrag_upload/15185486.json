  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present disclosure provides a description of electronic systems and automated methods for automatic email generation and delivery based on transaction account linkage, which cannot be achieved through human thought, using pen-and-paper, or through mere organization of human activity. A method for automatic email generation and delivery based on transaction account linkage includes: storing, in an account database of a processing server, a plurality of account profiles, wherein each account profile includes a structured data set related to a transaction account including at least a primary account number and an email address; receiving, by a receiving device of the processing server, a transaction message via a payment network, wherein the transaction message is related to a payment transaction and is formatted pursuant to one or more standards and includes at least a plurality of data elements including a first data element configured to store a specific primary account number, a second data element configured to store a merchant identifier of a plurality of merchant identifiers, and one or more additional data elements configured to store transaction data; executing, by a querying module of the processing server, a query on the account database to identify a specific account profile where the primary account number corresponds to the specific primary account number stored in the first data element included in the transaction message; generating, by a generation module of the processing server, an email message, wherein a body of the email message includes at least content generated from the transaction data stored in the one or more additional data elements included in the transaction message and a header of the email message includes the email address included in the identified specific account profile as a destination address; and electronically transmitting, by a transmitting device of the processing server, the generated email message to ...",
