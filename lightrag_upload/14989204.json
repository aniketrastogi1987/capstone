  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one illustrative embodiment, a method for evaluating a component of a vehicle is provided. Time series data generated during operation of the vehicle is received by a computer system. The computer system transforms the time series data into a plurality of segments based on a selected state for the vehicle that is of interest. The computer system builds a prognostic distance matrix based on pairings formed using the plurality of segments. The prognostic distance matrix comprises distances that measure deviation of the component from nominal performance for the selected state. The computer system generates a digital prognosis for the component of the vehicle based on the prognostic distance matrix. The digital prognosis predicts whether a maintenance operation should be performed with respect to the component. In another illustrative embodiment, an apparatus comprises a segment generator module, a distance generator module, and a health manager module, which are all implemented in a computer system. The segment generator module receives time series data generated during operation of a vehicle and transforms the time series data into a plurality of segments based on a selected state for the vehicle that is of interest. The distance generator module builds a prognostic distance matrix based on pairings formed using the plurality of segments. The prognostic distance matrix comprises distances that measure deviation of a component from nominal performance for the selected state. A health manager module generates a digital prognosis for the component of the vehicle based on the prognostic distance matrix. The digital prognosis predicts whether a maintenance operation should be performed with respect to the component. The distances may be used to diagnose what maintenance operation should be performed. In yet another illustrative embodiment, a health management system comprises a segment generator module, a distance generator module, and a health manag...",
