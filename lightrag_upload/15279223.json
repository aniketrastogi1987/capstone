  "abstract": "A system and method for providing various intuitive user interfaces for data science process end-to-end is disclosed. In one implementation, the various intuitive user interfaces include a series of user interfaces associated with a unified, project-based data science workspace that guide a user through the data science process as well as learn from the user in the data science process.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The present disclosure overcomes one or more of the deficiencies of the prior art at least in part by providing a system and method for providing a unified, project-based data scientist workspace to visually prepare, build, deploy, visualize and manage models, their results and datasets. According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, a system comprising one or more processors; and a memory including instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the system to: generate a user interface for presentation to a user, the user interface oriented around a first machine learning object in a data science process; determine a first context associated with the first machine learning object in the data science process; identify a second machine learning object related to the first machine learning object in the first context; generate a suggestion of a first action based on the first context; transmit, for display, the suggestion of the first action to the user on the user interface; receive, from the user, a confirmation to perform the first action; and manipulate one or more of the first machine learning object and the second learning object related to the first machine learning object in the first context based on the first action. In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include generating a user interface for presentation to a user, the user interface oriented around a first machine learning object in a data science process; determining a first context associated with the first machine learning object in the data science process; identifying a second machine learning object related to the first machine learning object in the first context; generating a suggestion of a first action based on the first context; transmitting, for display, the suggestion of the first action to the user on the user int...",
