According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a device for charging management, comprising: a processor; and a memory for storing instructions executable by the processor; wherein the processor is configured to perform: acquiring a target charging current value and an actual charging current value during a charging process, the target charging current value being a desired electric current value set for the charging process; calculating a consumed current value according to the target charging current value and the actual charging current value; and adjusting the target charging current value according to the consumed current value. According to a third aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor of a device, cause the device to perform a method for charging management, the method comprising: acquiring a target charging current value and an actual charging current value during a charging process, the target charging current value being a desired electric current value set for the charging process; calculating a consumed current value according to the target charging current value and the actual charging current value; and adjusting the target charging current value according to the consumed current value. It is to be understood that both the foregoing ge...",
