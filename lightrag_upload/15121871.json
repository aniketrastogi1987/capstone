  "abstract": "A work process management system includes at least one work device and an individual controller that is directly or indirectly attached to a work object to control the work device. Each of the work device includes a work-device-side storage, a work-device-side communicator, a work part, and a work-device-side control part. The individual controller includes an individual-controller-side storage in which a work content of a work process performed with the work device and associated setting information are stored, an individual-controller-side communicator, and an individual-controller-side calculation controller that transmits the work content of the work process performed with the work device and the associated setting information in which a performance result is reflected to the work-device-side communicator, and additionally store the received performance result in the individual-controller-side storage.",
