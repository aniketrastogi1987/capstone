  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a platform device by means of which items of information providing swarm information and stored at a first storage site are utilizable by the network participants and can be added to or changed according to strictly predefined processing criteria on provision of an agreement by the network participants. With regard to a platform device of the aforementioned type, this object is achieved in that the storage sites are subdivided on the platform into a plurality of themes and are in each case in the form of a dual unit (DuU) comprising in each case a first storage site assigned to a predefinable theme and provided with initial information formulated by an initial participant but not editable by any other individual user-participant, together with a second storage site which is assigned to the first storage site and is capable of being edited by the plurality of user-participants and is adapted for acceptance of inputted additional information relevant to the initial information stored at the first storage site. Preferred embodiments of the invention are the subject matter of the subordinate claims. With regard to the platform device of the invention, the combination of features to the effect that the storage sites are subdivided into a plurality of themes on the platform and are in each case in the form of a dual unit (DuU) comprising in each case a first storage site, assigned to a predefinable theme and provided with initial information formulated by an initial participant but not editable by any other individual user-participant, together with a second storage site assigned to the first storage site and capable of being edited by the plurality of individual user-participants and adapted for acceptance of inputted additional information relevant to the initial information stored at the first storage site has the result that the formation of dual units makes it possible for items of informatio...",
