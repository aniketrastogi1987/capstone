  "abstract": "Aspects of the present disclosure describe techniques for training a convolutional neural network using an inconsistent stochastic gradient descent (ISGD) algorithm. Training effort for training batches used by the ISGD algorithm are dynamically adjusted according to a determined loss for a given training batch which are classified into two sub states—well-trained or under-trained. The ISGD algorithm provides more iterations for under-trained batches while reducing iterations for well-trained ones.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An advance in the art is made according to aspects of the present disclosure directed to techniques for training a convolutional neural network using an inconsistent stochastic gradient descent (ISGD) algorithm. Training effort for training batches used by the ISGD algorithm are dynamically adjusted according to a determined loss for a given training batch which are classified into two sub states—well-trained or under-trained. In sharp contrast to prior art training methods the ISGD algorithm provides more iterations for under-trained batches while reducing iterations for well-trained ones. As a result, ISGD converges much faster than prior art methods, improves accuracy, and supports large batch sizes.",
