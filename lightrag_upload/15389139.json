  "abstract": "A neuromorphic device includes a synapse. The synapse includes a first electrode, a second electrode spaced apart from the first electrode, an oxygen-containing layer disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode, a reactive metal layer disposed between the oxygen-containing layer and the second electrode, and an oxygen diffusion-retarding layer disposed between the reactive metal layer and the oxygen-containing layer. The oxygen-containing layer includes a P-type material and oxygen ions. The reactive metal layer reacts with the oxygen ions of the oxygen-containing layer. The oxygen diffusion-retarding layer includes an N-type material and interferes with a movement of the oxygen ions from the oxygen-containing layer to the reactive metal layer. An interface between the oxygen-containing layer and the oxygen diffusion-retarding layer is a P-N junction.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a synapse having enhanced symmetry and linearity, and to a neuromorphic device including the same. In accordance with an embodiment, a synapse includes: a first electrode; a second electrode spaced apart from the first electrode; an oxygen-containing layer disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode, the oxygen-containing layer including a P-type material and oxygen ions; a reactive metal layer disposed between the oxygen-containing layer and the second electrode, the reactive metal layer reacting with the oxygen ions of the oxygen-containing layer; and an oxygen diffusion-retarding layer disposed between the reactive metal layer and the oxygen-containing layer, the oxygen diffusion-retarding layer including an N-type material and interfering with a movement of the oxygen ions from the oxygen-containing layer to the reactive metal layer, and wherein an interface between the oxygen-containing layer and the oxygen diffusion-retarding layer is a P-N junction. In the above embodiment, the synapse undergoes a reset operation when a reset voltage is applied to the synapse through the first electrode and the second electrode, the reset operation including forming or thickening a dielectric oxide layer in the reactive metal layer at an interface between the reactive metal layer and the oxygen diffusion-retarding layer, the reset voltage having a first polarity, and wherein the synapse undergoes a set operation when a set voltage is applied to the synapse through the first electrode and the second electrode, the set operation including removing or thinning the dielectric oxide layer, the set voltage having a second polarity opposite to the first polarity. During the reset operation, a reverse voltage is applied to the P-N junction, and wherein during the set operation, a forward voltage is applied to the P-N junction. The synapse undergoes a read operation when a read voltage is applie...",
