Here, the multi-pattern matching algorithm may further include, after the DF moving step, a DF 4 checking step of checking whether or not a bit of a related position in a fourth direct filter DF 4 for patterns having lengths larger than 2 bytes and less than 4 bytes is set to 1. Here, the multi-pattern matching algorithm may further include, after the DF 4 checking step, a PID recording step of, when the bit of a related position in the fourth direct filter DF 4 is set to 1, recording a pattern ID (PID) corresponding to the string in which the moving window is located, with reference to a first compact table CT 1 storing PIDs of the patterns having lengths larger than 2 bytes and less than 4 bytes. Here, the multi-pattern matching algorithm may further include, after the DF moving step, a DF 2 checking step of moving the moving window by two bytes from the current position, of converting the string of a length as much as 2 bytes on the moved position into an integer value, and of checking whether or not a bit of a related position in a second direct fi...",
