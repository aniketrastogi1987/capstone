  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one embodiment, a neural core circuit comprises a synaptic interconnect network including plural electronic synapses for interconnecting one or more source electronic neurons with one or more target electronic neurons. The interconnect network further includes multiple axon paths and multiple dendrite paths. Each synapse is at a cross-point junction of the interconnect network between a dendrite path and an axon path. The core circuit further comprises a routing module maintaining routing information. The routing module routes output from a source electronic neuron to one or more selected axon paths. Each synapse provides a configurable level of signal conduction from an axon path of a source electronic neuron to a dendrite path of a target electronic neuron. In another embodiment, a method comprises interconnecting at least one source electronic neuron in a neural core circuit with at least one target electronic neuron in the neural core circuit via a synaptic interconnect network. The interconnect network comprises plural electronic synapses, multiple axon paths, and multiple dendrite paths, wherein each synapse is at a cross-point junction of the interconnect network between a dendrite path and an axon path. The method further comprises routing output from a source electronic neuron to one or more selected axon paths using a routing module maintaining routing information, and configuring each synapse to provide a desired level of signal conduction from an axon path of a source electronic neuron to a dendrite path of a target electronic neuron. In yet another embodiment, a non-transitory computer-useable storage medium for producing spiking computation in a neural core circuit comprising a synaptic interconnect network including plural electronic synapses, multiple axon paths, and multiple dendrite paths is provided. Each synapse is at a cross-point junction of the interconnect network between a dendrite path and an axon path. The computer-us...",
