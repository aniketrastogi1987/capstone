  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF INVENTION <EOH>Embodiments of the invention provide a machine failure prediction solution which can handle long time gaps between successive failures. According to one aspect of the invention, a method for machine failure prediction is provided. The method comprises: identifying, by a first processor in a first computer system, a plurality of basic memory depth values based on a machine failure history; ascertaining, by the first processor, a basic weight range for each of the plurality of basic memory depth values according to a pre-stored table which is stored in a memory and includes a plurality of mappings wherein each mapping relates a basic memory depth value to a basic weight range, or according to a predetermined formula for calculating the basic weight range based on the corresponding basic memory depth value; ascertaining, by the first processor, a composite initial weight range by calculating an average weight range of the ascertained basic weight range for each identified basic memory depth value; generating, by the first processor, initial weights based on the composite initial weight range; and predicting, by the first processor, a future failure using a Back Propagation Through Time (BPTT) trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on the generated initial weights. According to another aspect of the invention, a system for machine failure prediction is provided. The system comprises: a first processor and a memory communicably coupled thereto, wherein the first memory is configured to store data to be executed by the first processor, wherein the first processor is configured to identify a plurality of basic memory depth values based on a machine failure history; ascertain a basic weight range for each of the plurality of basic memory depth values according to a pre-stored table which is stored in the memory and includes a plurality of mappings wherein each mapping relates a basic memory depth value to a basic weight range, or accord...",
