  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE <EOH>One aspect of the present disclosure includes a method for a personalized intelligent wake-up system based on multimodal deep neural network. The method comprises monitoring a sleeping status of a user; obtaining a current sleeping-stage of the user within a current time frame and a prediction of a next sleeping-stage of the user for a next time frame; correcting the current sleeping-stage of the user through combining the current sleeping-stage and the prediction of the next sleeping-stage; based on the current sleeping-stage of the user, prior knowledge learnt from sleep-related research studies, and at least one user preference of waking up, determining a wake up strategy for the current time frame; determining a relationship between each of a plurality of alarm impulses adopted to wake up the user and a corresponding reaction of the user; identifying a change in the current sleeping-stage for the current time frame; based on the wake-up strategy established for the current time frame and the relationship between each of the plurality of alarm impulses and the reaction of the user, determining an alarm impulse to be triggered for waking up the user; and triggering the determined alarm impulse. Another aspect of the present disclosure includes a personalized intelligent wake-up system based on multimodal deep neural network. The system comprises a robust sleeping-stage detection (RSSD) module configured to monitor a sleeping-stage of a user, obtain a current sleeping-stage of the user within a current time frame, predict a next sleeping-stage of the user for a next time frame, and correct the current sleeping-stage of the user; a wake-up strategy (WS) module configured to receive to establish a wake-up strategy for the current time frame, based on the current sleeping-stage of the user, prior knowledge learnt from sleep-related research studies, and at least one user preference of waking up; an alarm and user reaction reg...",
