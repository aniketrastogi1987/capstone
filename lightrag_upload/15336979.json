  "abstract": "A driving support device outputs, to a display means (103), a superimposed image in which a pair of left and right planar predicted trajectory guide marks (405), (406) corresponding to steering of the vehicle are superimposed onto a captured vehicle-rearview image including the tow vehicle connector (402) and the towed-vehicle connector (404). An image superimposing unit (112) superimposes sides (405a), (406a) of the predicted trajectory guide marks (405), (406) that are on the vehicle-width-center side further towards the outer edge relative to the tow vehicle connector (402), and superimposes sides (405b), (406b) of the predicted trajectory guide marks (405), (406) that are on the outer-edge side in the vehicle-width direction as predicted trajectories of the side edges of the vehicle.",
