  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, it is a primary aspect of the present invention to provide direct mapping method and system for converting MODBUS data into IEC61850 data based on machine learning, which can reduce the cost for software/hardware when a MODBUS device is added to an IEC61850 system. According to one aspect of the present invention, a data direct mapping method includes: generating a simulation value based on external information; estimating a parameter indicated by a measurement value through machine learning using the measurement value outputted from a generating device and the generated simulation value; and converting a data structure of the measurement value with reference to the estimated parameter. The external information may include at least one of environment information and a system condition. The estimating may include: comparing a pattern of the measurement value and a pattern of the simulation value; and estimating, as the parameter of the measurement value, a parameter indicated by a simulation value having highest pattern similarity, which is above a reference value, with respect to the measurement value. The data direct mapping method may further include, when there is no simulation value having pattern similarity higher than the reference value with respect to the measurement value, re-generating a simulation value of machine learning and re-estimating a parameter. The re-generated simulation value may be re-generated by making change to the external information which is used for the already generated simulation value. The converting may include converting a data structure of the measurement value into a data structure which is defined in a standard for the estimated parameter. The data direct mapping method may further include: receiving a command; grasping a corresponding parameter based on contents of the received command; and converting a format of the command with r...",
