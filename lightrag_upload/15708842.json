The P(TM) is comprised of a first set of performable machine code actions, having one or more performable machine code P(TM(i)) action, wherein each performable machine code P(TM(i)) action is configured as an implementation of an algorithmic procedure of a model, wherein a first P(TM(i)) provides an action of self-configuring a first vocabulary of Things in said non-transitory memory of the Thing Machine, said Things representative of Things that said processor can perform as actions, and the set of Things an action can act upon, and wherein at least one P(TM(i)) machine code action is performed to configure a second vocabulary of Things in the non-transitory memory of the Thing Machine representative of a core vocabulary through which an application can be provided.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Embodiments of the present invention provide a Thing Machine that represents actions the Thing Machine can perform, and the Things that the actions act upon, as instances of Things administered in non-transitory memory using a multi-dimensional graph model. The Thing Machine contains a processor, non-transitory memory, non-transitory computer readable media, and performable machine code P(TM). The P(TM) is comprised of a first set of performable machine code actions, having one or more performable machine code P(TM(i)) action, wherein each performable machine code P(TM(i)) action is configured as an implementation of an algorithmic procedure of a model, wherein a first P(TM(i)) provides an action of self-configuring a first vocabulary of Things in said non-transitory memory of the Thing Machine, said Things representative of Things that said processor can perform as actions, and the set of Things an action can act upon, and wherein at least one P(TM(i)) machine code action is performed to configure a second vocabulary of Things in the non-transitory memory of the Thing Machine representative of a core vocabulary through which an application can be provided.",
