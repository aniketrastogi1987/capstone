  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a system and method of delivering encrypted content to a user computer via a communication network are provided. Queries are generated using said user computer to search for content via said communication network. The content can be available from an information provider via a server and the communication network, for example. Raw unencrypted data files or content can be encrypted and stored at a particular location as well as a unique dataset code and key. Selected content is retrieved from the server data repository in response to the queries. A machine-dependent product code is generated at the user computer. The product code comprises a unique identifier corresponding to said user computer and the dataset code. A request for at least one content item and the product code is transmitted to the information provider. The provider uses the product code to generate a release code to enable the user to decrypt the requested content.",

  "abstract": "A data distribution system is provided which supplies customers with an executable for requested secured data files to provide the customer with fulfillment software, obviating the need for the customer to download fulfillment software prior to requesting secure data. The data distribution system is characterized by server technology which can dynamically encrypt secured data files just prior to a customer request to download the data file. A framework for building a universal data distribution infrastructure is provided which employs Requesters.",
