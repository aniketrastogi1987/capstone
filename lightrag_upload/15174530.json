  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present disclosure relates to systems, devices, and methods for generating domain name suggestions by obtaining a domain name suggestion input that includes textual data, segmenting the textual data into tokens, obtaining a list of possible affixes to the textual data, determining conditional probabilities for the possible affixes using a language model, ranking the list of possible affixes based on the conditional probabilities to generate a ranked list of affixes, and generating domain name suggestions based on the ranked list of affixes. In various embodiments, a single token can represent one word or multiple words. In an embodiment, the list of possible affixes can include generic top level domains. In an embodiment, the language model can be trained using a training set of textual data. In an embodiment, the list of possible affixes can include words from the training set of textual data. In an embodiment, the language model can be a feed-forward neural network with one or more non-linear hidden layers. In an embodiment, the language model can be a log-linear language model. In an embodiment, the training set of textual data can be a domain name system zone file. In an embodiment, the conditional probabilities can be position dependent. In an embodiment, the conditional probabilities can be position independent. In an embodiment, the domain name suggestions can be generated based on top ranked affixes. In an embodiment, the domain name suggestion can be generated based on affixes associated with conditional probabilities that meet or exceed a threshold. In an embodiment, the domain name suggestions can be displayed in a browser.",
