  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Some embodiments include a computerized method for performing a genetic algorithm that evolves a population of candidate solutions to solve an optimization problem. In some embodiments, the method includes may comprise determining, by an adaptive cataclysm controller operating on one or more processors, that the population of candidate solutions has converged during a run of the genetic algorithm. The method can also include determining, by the adaptive cataclysm controller operating on the one or more processors, a cause for convergence of the population based, at least in part, on an analysis of the run of the genetic algorithm. The method can also include selecting, by the adaptive cataclysm controller operating on the one or more processors, a first cataclysm strategy of a plurality of different cataclysm strategies based, at least in part, on one of the cause for the convergence and a history of the run of the genetic algorithm. The method can also include simulating, by the adaptive cataclysm controller operating on the one or more processors, a cataclysm based on the first cataclysm strategy.",
