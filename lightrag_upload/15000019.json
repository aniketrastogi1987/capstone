  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The inventive methodology is directed to methods and systems that substantially obviate one or more of the above and other problems associated with conventional techniques for network proxy detection. In accordance with one aspect of the embodiments described herein, there is provided a computer-implemented method for detecting a proxy, the method being performed in connection with a networking system comprising a web server, a domain name system (DNS) server and a database system, the method involving: receiving at the web server a request from a client; responsive to the received request, generating a file containing a domain name information and a file name information and storing the domain name information and the file name information in the database system and returning the generated script file to the client; receiving a DNS request on the DNS server, the DNS request specifying a domain name specified in the file generated by the web server; responsive to the received DNS request, storing a first origination IP address associated with received DNS request and the domain name information in the database system; receiving at the web server a second request from a client, the second request with a file name information specified in a web server response to the request from the client; responsive to the received second request, storing a second origination IP address associated with received second request and the second file name information in the database system; and determining whether the second origination IP is the proxy based on information stored in the database system. In one or more embodiments, the script file is a Java Script file. In one or more embodiments, the domain name information and the file name information are both randomly generated. In one or more embodiments, the determining whether the second origination IP is the proxy is based on comparing the stored domain name information and a file name informat...",
