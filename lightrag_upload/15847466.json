  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present disclosure provides a convolution circuit applicable to an application processor and a method thereof. An embodiment of the inventive concept provides an operation method of a convolution circuit: receiving input feature maps; generating output feature maps corresponding to the respective input feature maps through convolution operations for performing parallel processing with a kernel unit; and outputting the output feature maps to an external memory. In an embodiment, the kernel unit may include KÃ—K window filtering (K is a natural number). The method may further include storing each of the input feature maps in an internal memory of a chip corresponding to K lines. In an embodiment, the generating of the output feature maps may include storing kernels necessary for generating the output feature maps in the external memory. In an embodiment, the method may further include repeating loading and accumulating a partial sum of the convolution operation from the external memory, or storing the partial sum in the external memory. In an embodiment, at least one of the parallel processing convolutions may use a physically different memory for its data multiplied by the kernel weights. In an embodiment, result values of each of the parallel processing convolutions may be stored in the external memory in a predetermined order. In an embodiment, at least one of the convolution operations may be performed while outputting at least one of the output feature maps to the external memory. In an embodiment, a plurality of feature map data may be output at the same time while receiving the plurality of feature map data from the external memory. In an embodiment of the inventive concept, a convolution circuit includes: a direct memory access (DMA) processing unit configured to read data from an external memory or output data to the external memory; a kernel buffer configured to store kernel data for connecting an input feature map being processed and N...",
