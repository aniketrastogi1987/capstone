  "abstract": "Training prediction models and applying machine learning prediction to data is illustrated herein. A prediction instance comprising a set of data and metadata associated with the set of data identifying a prediction type is obtained. The data and metadata are used to determine an entity to train a prediction model using the prediction type. A trained prediction model is obtained from the entity. A notification system may be configured to react to monitor contextual information and apply the prediction. A workflow system may automatically perform a function in a workflow based on prediction.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>Training prediction models and applying machine learning prediction to data is illustrated herein. A prediction instance comprising a set of data and metadata associated with the set of data identifying a prediction type is obtained. The data and metadata are used to determine an entity to train a prediction model using the prediction type. As a result, a trained prediction model is obtained from the entity. This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Additional features and advantages will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practice of the teachings herein. Features and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. Features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter.",
