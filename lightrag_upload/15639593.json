  "abstract": "A machine learning management apparatus identifies a maximum prediction performance score amongst a plurality of prediction performance scores corresponding to a plurality of models generated by executing each of a plurality of machine learning algorithms. As for a first machine learning algorithm having generated a model corresponding to the maximum prediction performance score, the machine learning management apparatus determines a first training dataset size to be used when the first machine learning algorithm is executed next time based on the maximum prediction performance score, first estimated prediction performance scores, and first estimated runtimes. As for a second machine learning algorithm different from the first machine learning algorithm, the machine learning management apparatus determines a second training dataset size to be used when the second machine learning algorithm is executed next time based on the maximum prediction performance score, second estimated predict...",
