  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Aspects of the present invention provide a method and apparatus for effectively detecting a repetitive pattern in an input image in order to detect a defect by visual detection without a reference image. Aspects of the present invention also provide a method of detecting a defect in a test image using a repetitive pattern detected in an input image in order to detect a defect by visual detection without a reference image. However, aspects of the present invention are not restricted to the one set forth herein. The above and other aspects of the present invention will become more apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains by referencing the detailed description of the present invention given below. According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of detecting a repetitive pattern. The method includes: clustering a plurality of pixels that form an input image according to color and obtaining one or more color layers composed of pixels included in each cluster; selecting one or more effective layers from the color layers, wherein each of the effective layers includes a predetermined number or more of pixel components, each composed of a plurality of pixels and having a predetermined shape or a predetermined size of area; selecting a unit pattern repeatedly disposed at different locations in each effective layer from the pixel components included in each effective layer; calculating distances between the unit patterns in each effective layer; and calculating a repetition cycle of the unit pattern of the input image based on the calculated distances in each effective layer.",
