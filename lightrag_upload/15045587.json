The method comprises receiving, by an interaction device, conversation data of a user interacting with the ECA, wherein the ECA is presented on an interface of the interaction device. The method further comprises determining, by the interaction device, an emotional state of the user based on one or more behavioral parameters associated with the conversation data of the user. The method comprises identifying, by the interaction device, a response state for the ECA corresponding to the emotional state of the user, wherein the response state is identified from a plurality of response states based on a pre-defined probability for each response state.
