  "abstract": "A computer implemented method predicting a next event in a sequence of events in a story narrative. The method reads narrative data, the narrative data comprising a sequence of words arranged in sentence patterns. The method extracts event records from the narrative data, the event records ordered to create a story. Mapping event records to a story rule is then performed to create a sequence of story events based on the event records and the story rule. The technology then outputs a first predictive event based on the sequence of story events, the predictive story event generated from at least one predictive method of a plurality of predictive methods. The outputting is repeated for a second predictive method of the plurality of predictive methods to produce a second predictive event.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The technology, briefly described, comprises a system and method for analyzing narrative data based to produce a prediction of a next, unseen event in a story based on a sequence of events. The technology takes the form of a computer implemented method, a computing system and/or code configured to instruct a computing system to perform a plurality of computing steps to produce an analysis of input narrative data. The technology may comprise a computer implemented method predicting a next event in a sequence of events in a story narrative. The method reads narrative data, the narrative data comprising a sequence of words arranged in sentence patterns. The method extracts event records from the narrative data, the event records ordered to create a story. Mapping event records to a story rule is then performed to create a sequence of story events based on the event records and the story rule. The technology then outputs a first predictive event based on the sequence of story events, the predictive story event generated based on at least one protagonist, and the first predictive method comprises evaluating semiotic similarities in behavior between the protagonist and another actor. The outputting is repeated for a second predictive method of the plurality of predictive methods to produce a second predictive event. The predictive methods can take the form of statistical methods, such as Markov chains, narrative balance of story and actor events, and protagonist behavioral patterns. This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.",
