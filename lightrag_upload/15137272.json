  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>An object of this invention is to improve processing associated with floating point operations. Another object of the present invention is to provide a simple mechanism for a computer to determine whether a requested floating-point operation function is installed on the computer, and, if that function is not installed, to inform a program or application, which is running on the computer, of the fact that the requested function is not installed. These and other objectives are attained with a method and system for executing a machine instruction in a central processing unit. The method comprises the steps of obtaining a perform floating point operation instruction; in response to obtaining said perform floating point operation instruction, obtaining a test bit; determining a value of the test bit. If the test bit has a first test bit value, (a) a specified floating-point operation function is performed, and (b) a condition code is set to a value determined by said specified function. If the test bit has a second test bit value, (c) a check is made to determine if said specified function is valid and installed on the machine, (d) if said specified function is valid and installed on the machine, the condition code is set to a first predetermined value, and (e) if said specified function is either not valid or not installed on the machine, the condition code is set to a second predetermined value.
