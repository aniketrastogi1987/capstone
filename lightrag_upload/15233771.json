  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In one aspect of the present invention, a touchscreen device comprises: a touch sensitive screen; and a processor configured to receive a touch signal effectuated by a user touching event, through the touch sensitive screen, wherein the touch sensitive screen enables a user to control processing functions of the processor through a detected intentional touching event effectuated by the user, wherein the processor is configured to determine whether the touch signal is associated with an intentional touching event by determining whether a touch strength signal value of the touch signal is above or below a touch signal threshold value, wherein a touch strength signal value above the touch signal threshold value is determined to be associated with an intentional touching event, wherein the touch signal threshold value is calibrated by the processor based on user touchscreen input by: collecting at least one sample of touch strength signal values over at least one user input session; analyzing the at least one sample to determine if an initial touch signal threshold value requires adjusting, wherein analyzing the at least one sample comprises determining a central value based on a statistical analysis of the at least one sample of touch strength signal values; and determining a calibrated touch signal threshold value based on the analysis of the at least one sample, wherein the calibrated touch strength signal value may be the initial touch signal threshold value, or an adjusted touch strength signal value based on the central value, and wherein the calibrated touch signal threshold value is used in determining an intentional touching event. In another aspect of the present invention, a computer-implemented method for determining an intentional touching event on a touchscreen device, comprises executing on a processor of the device the steps of: receiving, by a processor, a touch signal effectuated by a user touching event, through a t...",

  "abstract": "Disclosed is a method for determining an intentional touching event on a touchscreen, including a touchscreen virtual keyboard, by individualizing and/or adjusting a touch signal threshold value to obtain a calibrated value, wherein the touch signal threshold value is used in determining an intentional touching event by determining if a strength of a touch signal associated with a touching event falls above or below the calibrated threshold value. Adjusting the touch signal threshold value may be based on the user's active input, and may be statistically determined based on at least one sample of touch signal values.",
