  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In view of the technical problem in the art of returning irrelevant geofences to a user as a result of the limited number of geofences available on the platforms and the distance-only filter, the inventors have considered the technical solution to the technical problem in which the geofences are filtered based on cognitive preferences of the user as well, as distance to return to the user the most relevant geofences even in areas with a number of geofences exceeding the platform capabilities. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention can provide a geofence filtering system including a user location monitoring circuit configured to monitor a pinpoint location of a user and a boundary location of the user, a geofence determining circuit configured to determine a plurality of geofences that overlap with the boundary location of the user, the plurality of geofences being stored in a database, and a cognitive filtering and ranking circuit configured to filter the plurality of geofences that overlap with the boundary location of the user based on a cognitive factor and to rank the filtered geofences based on the cognitive factor to deliver to a user device when a pinpoint location of the user overlaps with the plurality of geofences. Further, in another exemplary embodiment, the present invention can provide a geofence filtering method including monitoring a pinpoint location of a user and a boundary location of the user, determining a plurality of geofences that overlap with the boundary location of the user, the plurality of geofences being stored in a database, and filtering and ranking the plurality of geofences that overlap with the boundary location of the user based on a cognitive factor and to rank the filtered geofences based on the cognitive factor to deliver to a user device when a pinpoint location of the user overlaps with the plurality of geofences. Even further, in another exemplary embodiment, the present invention can provide a ...",
