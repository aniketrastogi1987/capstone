  "abstract": "Provided is a vehicle-mounted program writing device that writes an updated program and updated data to a vehicle-mounted control device without a driver feeling inconvenienced. A relay device has: a means for receiving updated program data for a plurality of vehicle-mounted control devices and transmitted from an external center when an ignition is in an off state before a predetermined first time slot; and a means for waking up the vehicle-mounted control devices when a write start command transmitted within the first time slot is received from the external center, and cause a transition to a repro mode. The vehicle-mounted program writing device is such that the vehicle-mounted control devices notify the relay device of the transition to the repro mode, and the relay device executes writing of an updated program and updated data to the vehicle-mounted control devices during the first time slot on the basis of the presence or absence of updated program data for the vehicle-mounted co...",
