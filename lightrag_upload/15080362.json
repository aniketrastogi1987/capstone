  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the claimed subject matter. This summary is not an extensive overview. It is not intended to identify key or critical aspects or elements or to delineate the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. The present invention is a communication structure and system for simultaneous personal and broadcast communications. In embodiments, the communication structure and system offers private telecommunication capabilities while at the same time offering a platform from which a broad audience can be reached. Accordingly, the communication structure is capable of communicating an advertisement message to a broad audience and is thus capable of supporting a national advertising campaign. It is understood that the revenue generated from national advertising campaign may pay for the telecommunication and maintenance costs of the communication structure.",

  "abstract": "A communication structure for both personal communication services and broadly disseminated communication services is described. The communication structure includes a communication unit having telecommunication capability enabling a user of the communication structure to communicate to a remote individual. The communication structure also including multiple displays capable of displaying text, image, video data and further including non-digital advertising surfaces for displaying static images and a speaker system for broadcasting messages. The multiple displays and non-digital advertising surfaces allowing for communication with individuals within visual range of the communication structure. The multiple displays having synchronization capability, allowing for coordination of the text, image and video data displayed. The communication structure being connectable to other communication structures and the multiple displays of the multiple communication structures also having synchroniz...",
