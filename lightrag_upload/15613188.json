  "abstract": "An example system and method for managing behavior change applications for mobile users is disclosed. In an embodiment of the system and method, data on a plurality of users in a behavioral change program is received from a plurality of devices operating in a communications network. The data is used to determine plurality of user segments. Each user of the plurality of users is classified into a one of the plurality of user segments. Then a plurality of behavioral models is determined, where each of the plurality of behavioral models comprises a statistical model of relations between behaviors of users within a corresponding one of the plurality of user segments. An intervention model is then determined for a user, where the intervention model is based on a behavior model of the user segment to which the user belongs. Interventions are then sent to a device of the user according to the intervention model.",
