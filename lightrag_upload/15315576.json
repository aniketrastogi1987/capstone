  "abstract": "A tactile sensation presentation device is provided whereby a tactile sensation is provided in a direction in which a vibration can easily be felt by an operator. A tactile sensation presentation device (1) includes a panel (10) having, within a front surface (100), a surface shape such that respective normal lines at two different points intersect by being parallel moved, a detector (12) that detects an operation performed on the front surface (100) of the panel (10), a tactile sensation presenter (14) that presents a tactile sensation to an operator by providing a vibration to the panel (10), and a controller (16) that controls the tactile sensation presenter (14) so as to present the vibration in a direction intersecting a tangential plane including a detection point where the operation is detected.",
