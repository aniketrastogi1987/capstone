  "abstract": "The present invention relates to a device for the evaluation of a time interval between two excitations, comprising at least one excitable material that can be brought, at least partially, into an excited state by means of an excitation, whereby the excitability of the material that is in this excited state changes over time. Furthermore, the present invention also relates to a method for the evaluation of a time interval between two excitations, to the use of a device according to the invention, as well as to an artificial neural network comprising at least one device according to the invention.",
