  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>In some embodiments, a product such as a variance swap may have a price or other parameter tied to a parameter of a reference product. For example, a product such as a variance swap may have a price (such as a strike price) that is defined with reference to another trading product such as the VIX. For example, a variance swap may have a strike price determined by a price differential to the VIX.",

  "abstract": "Various embodiments are directed to a system and method for specifying a transaction for a product having a parameter such as price (e.g., strike price) defined with reference to a parameter (such as price) of another asset. In some embodiments, at least one processor may receive indicia indicating a trading product having a price defined as a differential to a reference product. At least one processor may determine a price of the reference product. At least one processor may calculate a price of the trading product by adding the differential to or subtracting the differential from the price of the reference product. The calculated price may be transmitted via a network to an output device.",
