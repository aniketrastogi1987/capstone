  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The invention is directed to a touch display apparatus to reduce the weight and assembly complexity of a touch display apparatus. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a touch display apparatus capable of fingerprint recognition includes a display panel, a cover plate, a touch sensing electrode set and a fingerprint recognition electrode set. The display panel includes a first surface. The cover plate covers the first surface, and includes a second surface facing the first surface. The touch sensing electrode set is disposed between the display panel and the cover plate. The fingerprint recognition electrode set is directly formed on the first surface of the display panel or directly formed on the second surface of the cover plate. The cover plate further covers the fingerprint recognition electrode set. According to another embodiment of the present invention, a touch display apparatus capable of fingerprint recognition includes a display panel, a cover plate, a touch sensing electrode set, a substrate and a fingerprint recognition electrode set. The display panel includes a first surface. The cover plate covers the first surface of the display panel, and includes a second surface facing the first surface. The touch sensing electrode set is disposed between the display panel and the cover plate. The substrate includes a third surface facing the second surface. The fingerprint recognition electrode set is formed on the third surface of the substrate. The cover plate further covers the fingerprint recognition electrode set. According to another embodiment of the present invention, a fingerprint recognition module is formed on a substrate, and includes at least one key, a fingerprint recognition electrode set and a chip. The key is disposed on the substrate. The fingerprint recognition electrode set is formed on the substrate. The chip is soldered on the substrate. The key and the fingerprint recognition electrode set...",
