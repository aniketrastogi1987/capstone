  "abstract": "Computer-implemented systems and methods are disclosed for automatically generating predictive models using data driven featurization. The systems and methods provide for obtaining data associated with a target event, annotating the data to identify a target event and establishing one or more limits on the data, censoring the data based on the annotations, determining features of the censored data, and analyzing the features to determine a predictive model. In some embodiments, the systems and methods further provide for converting the features into a binary representation and analyzing the binary representation to produce the predictive model.",
