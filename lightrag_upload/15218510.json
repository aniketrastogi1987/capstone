  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A computer-based system includes a computer-processable definition of a region in a data set. The system identifies a region of the data set based on the definition of the region. The system provides output to a user representing a question and the identified region of the data set. The system may also automatically generate an answer to the question based on the question and the data set, and provide output to the user representing the answer. The system may generate the answer based on a subset of the data set, and provide output to the user representing the subset of the data set. The user may provide feedback on the first answer to the system, which the system may use to improve subsequent answers to the same and other questions, and to disable the system's automatic question-answering function in response to disagreement between the user and the system. For example, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to a computer-implemented method for use with a system, wherein the system includes a data set and a first question instance including first text and a first region definition. The method includes: (1) identifying a first region of the data set based on the first region definition; (2) providing output to a user representing the first question instance; and (3) providing output to the user representing the first region of the data set. Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a computer-implemented method for use with a system, wherein the system includes a data set and a first question instance including first text and a first region definition. The method includes: (1) for each of a plurality of instances Q of the first question: (1) (a) identifying a region R Q of the data set based on the first region definition; (1) (b) receiving a computer-generated answer C Q in response to instance Q of the first question; (1) (c) providing output to a user representing instance Q of the first question; (1) (d) providing...",
