  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In one embodiment the present invention is implemented as a global interconnect system. The global interconnect system includes a plurality of resources having data for supporting the execution of multiple code sequences and a plurality of engines for implementing the execution of the multiple code sequences. A plurality of resource consumers are within each of the plurality of engines. A global interconnect structure is coupled to the plurality of resource consumers and coupled to the plurality of resources to enable data access and execution of the multiple code sequences, wherein the resource consumers access the resources through a per cycle utilization of the global interconnect structure. The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the present invention, as defined solely by the claims, will become apparent in the non-limiting detailed description set forth below.",

  "abstract": "A method for allocation of a segmented interconnect in an integrate circuit is disclosed. The method comprises receiving a plurality of requests from a plurality of resource consumers of a plurality of engines to access a plurality of resources, wherein the resources are spread across the plurality of engines and contain data for supporting execution of multiple code sequences. The method also comprises contending for the plurality of resources in accordance with requests from the plurality of resource consumers. Finally, the method comprises accessing the plurality of resources via a global interconnect structure, wherein the global interconnect structure has a finite number of buses accessible each clock cycle, and wherein the global interconnect structure comprises a plurality of global segment buses.",
