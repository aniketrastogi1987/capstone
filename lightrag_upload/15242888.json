  "abstract": "A computer-implemented system and method of analyzing spatial, temporal and contextual elements of data for predictive decision-making. The computer-implemented method includes receiving a first set of rules and receiving first data and second data including spatial, temporal and contextual elements. The computer-implemented method also includes identifying each rule of the first set for which the received first data and the received second data is a respective candidate. For the identified rules for which the received first data is a candidate, and for the identified rules for which the received second data is a candidate, the respective received first data and received second data is indexed by its temporal, spatial or contextual elements as a function of the identified rules. The computer-implemented method also includes identifying an event as satisfying an identified rule in memory using the indexed first and second data.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a computer-implemented method for predictive decision-making is provided. The computer-implemented method includes receiving a first set of rules and receiving first data including spatial, temporal and contextual elements. The computer-implemented method also includes identifying each rule of the first set for which the received first data is a candidate. For the identified rules for which the received first data is a candidate, the first received data is indexed in memory (e.g. Random Access Memory (RAM)) by its temporal, spatial or contextual elements as a function of the identified rules. The computer-implemented method also includes receiving second data including spatial, temporal and contextual elements and identifying each rule of the first set for which the received second data is a candidate. For the identified rules for which the received second data is a candidate, the received second data is indexed in memory by its temporal, spatial or contextual elements as a function of the identified rules. The computer-implemented method further includes identifying an event as satisfying an identified rule in memory using the indexed first and second data. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a computer-implemented method for predictive decision-making is provided. The computer-implemented method includes receiving a request for a new rule defining a relationship between spatial, temporal and contextual elements. The computer-implemented method also includes identifying an existing rule having a defined relationship between spatial, temporal and contextual elements and recommending a modification to said new rule request based on the identified existing rule. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a computer-implemented method for predictive decision-making is provided. The computer-implemented method includes receiving a first set of rules. The computer-implemented method also inc...",
