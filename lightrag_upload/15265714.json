  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A computer-implemented method according to one embodiment includes creating a profile for a user, the profile including one or more default aspects created automatically by a system and one or more custom aspects created in response to textual input by the user, comparing event data to the profile, and providing a recommendation to the user, based on the comparing. According to another embodiment, a computer program product for providing recommendations utilizing a user profile comprises a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, wherein the computer readable storage medium is not a transitory signal per se, and where the program instructions are executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform a method comprising creating a profile for a user, utilizing the processor, the profile including one or more default aspects created automatically by a system and one or more custom aspects created in response to textual input by the user, comparing event data to the profile, utilizing the processor, and providing, utilizing the processor, a recommendation to the user, based on the comparing. A system according to another embodiment includes a processor, and logic integrated with the processor, executable by the processor, or integrated with and executable by the processor, the logic being configured to create a profile for a user, the profile including one or more default aspects created automatically by a system and one or more custom aspects created in response to textual input by the user, compare event data to the profile, and provide a recommendation to the user, based on the comparison. Other aspects and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which, when taken in conjunction with the drawings, illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention.",
