  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to an aspect of the present principles, a method is provided for acquiring data from an input signal using multitask regression. The method includes receiving, into a memory, the input signal, the input signal including data that includes a plurality of features. The method further includes determining at least two computational tasks to analyze within the input signal and regularizing all of the at least two tasks using shared adaptive weights. The method yet further includes performing, using a processor, a multitask regression on the input signal to create a solution path for all of the at least two tasks, wherein the multitask regression includes updating a model coefficient and a regularization weight together under an equality norm constraint until convergence is reached to produce a sparse model in the solution path, and updating the model coefficient and regularization weight together under an updated equality norm constraint that has a greater l 1 -penalty than the previous equality norm constraint until convergence is reached to produce another sparse model in the solution path. The method additionally includes selecting a sparse model from the solution path, constructing an image using the sparse model, and displaying the image on a display. According to another aspect of the present principles, a system is provided for acquiring data from an input signal using multitask regression. The system includes a memory to receive the input signal, the input signal including data that includes a plurality of features. The system further includes a processor, the processor being configured to: determine at least two computational tasks to analyze within the input signal; regularize all of the at least two tasks using shared adaptive weights; perform a multitask regression on the input signal to create a solution path for all of the at least two tasks, select a sparse model from the solution path; and construct an image using the sparse ...",
