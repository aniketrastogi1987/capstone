  "abstract": "Mechanisms are provided in which a first knowledge graph, comprising nodes representing entities and edges between nodes indicative of a relationship between the entities, is received. The mechanisms identify a candidate missing edge connecting a node of the first knowledge graph to another node not present in the first knowledge graph and evaluate the candidate missing edge to determine if the candidate missing edge should be added to the first knowledge graph. The mechanisms expand the first knowledge graph to include the candidate missing edge connecting the node to a newly added node that is newly added to the first knowledge graph, to thereby generate an expanded knowledge graph, in response to the evaluation indicating that the candidate missing edge should be added to the first knowledge graph. The mechanisms then perform an operation on the expanded knowledge graph to generate a knowledge output.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described herein in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. In one illustrative embodiment, a method, in a data processing system comprising at least one processor and at least one memory, the at least one memory comprising instructions which are executed by the at least one processor configure the at least one processor to perform the method. The method comprises receiving, by the data processing system, a first knowledge graph comprising nodes representing entities and edges between nodes. Each edge represents a relationship between the nodes directly connected to each other by the edge. The method further comprises identifying, by the data processing system, at least one candidate missing edge connecting at least one node of the first knowledge graph to at least one other node not present in the first knowledge graph and evaluating, by the data processing system, the at least one candidate missing edge to determine if the at least one candidate missing edge should be added to the first knowledge graph. The method also comprises expanding, by the data processing system, the first knowledge graph to include the at least one candidate missing edge connecting the at least one node to at least one newly added node that is newly added to the first knowledge graph, to thereby generate an expanded knowledge graph, in response to the evaluation indicating that the at least one candidate missing edge should be added to the first knowledge graph. Furthermore, the method comprises performing, by the data processing system, an operation on the expanded knowledge graph to generate a knowledge output. In other illustrative embodiments, a computer program product comprising a computer useable ...",
