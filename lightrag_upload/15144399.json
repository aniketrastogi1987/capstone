  "abstract": "Embodiments of the present invention provide systems, methods, and computer storage media directed at transforming event logs into features for use in machine learning. In embodiments, a method may include receiving an event log for a user. The event log can indicate an occurrence of a first event associated with the user. The method can also include generating a feature value for the first event. The feature value can be indicative of an amount of time that has passed since the occurrence of the first event. Based, at least in part, on the feature value, an occurrence of a second event can be predicted utilizing a predictive model. The prediction can then be output to enable targeted content associated with the second event to be delivered to the user. Other embodiments may be described and/or claimed herein.",
