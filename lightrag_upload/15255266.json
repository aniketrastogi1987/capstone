  "abstract": "A method, system, mediation server, client, and computer program for deleting a copied file in which a master file is duplicated while maintaining a certain level of security. A mediation server receives and stores a copied file in which a master file stored in a server is duplicated, generates private-key information and public-key information, and transmits the generated public-key information and the copied file to a client. The client receives and stores the copied file and the public-key information. In a case where the copied file is updated, the client encrypts difference information on the difference arising in the updating using the public-key information and transmits the difference information to the mediation server. The client determines whether the condition for being secure is satisfied when a process for updating the copied file becomes possible. When determining that the condition is not satisfied, the client deletes the copied file.",
