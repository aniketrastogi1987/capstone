  "abstract": "Systems and methods may include neuromorphic traffic control, such as between cores on a chip or between cores on different chips. The neuromorphic traffic control may include a plurality of routers organized in a mesh to transfer messages; and a plurality of neuron cores connected to the plurality of routers, the neuron cores in the plurality of neuron cores to advance in discrete time-steps, send spike messages to other neuron cores in the plurality of neuron cores during a time-step, and send barrier messages.",
