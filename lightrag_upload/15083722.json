  "abstract": "Techniques are disclosed for facilitating re-creation of an application collection of a source computing device at a destination computing device. The techniques include receiving a source application identifier indicative of a source application edition, the edition of the application being programmed for a source operating system. The techniques also include receiving an indicator of a destination operating system. The techniques further include determining a source canonical application corresponding to the source application edition based on the source application identifier, the source canonical application being a representative of one or more application editions including the source application edition. The techniques also include determining a set of destination application editions that are likely similar to the source application edition based on the source canonical application, the set of destination application editions indicating one or more destination application editi...",
