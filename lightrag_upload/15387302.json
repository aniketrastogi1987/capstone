  "abstract": "Ensemble classification algorithms having subclass resolution are disclosed. An example disclosed apparatus includes a fingerprint generator to generate a fingerprint of class probabilities of each of a plurality of samples, a distribution creator to create a distribution of the samples based on the generated fingerprints, and a distribution applicator to apply the distribution to a population to predict sub-class probabilities of each of the population.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example environment, in which an example data collection may operate to develop class probabilities as disclosed herein. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example implementation of an example population data analyzer of FIG. 1 in accordance with the teachings of this disclosure. FIG. 3 is a flowchart representative of example machine readable instructions for implementing the example population data analyzer of FIGS. 1 and 2 . FIG. 4 is a flowchart representative of example machine readable instructions for implementing the example population data analyzer of FIGS. 1 and 2 . FIG. 5 is a flowchart representative of example machine readable instructions for implementing the example population data analyzer of FIGS. 1 and 2 . FIG. 6 is a set of tables illustrating an example operation of the example population data analyzer of FIGS. 1 and 2 . FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an example processor platform capable of executing machine readable instructions to implement the example machine readable instructions of FIGS. 3, 4 and/or 5 . detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"? The figures are not to scale. Instead, to clarify multiple layers and regions, the thickness of the layers may be enlarged in the drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawing(s) and accompanying written description to refer to the same or like parts.",
