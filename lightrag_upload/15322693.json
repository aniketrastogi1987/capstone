  "abstract": "A data processing apparatus that processes a spectral data item which stores, for each of a plurality of spectral components, an intensity value, includes a spectral component selecting unit and a classifier generating unit. The spectral component selecting unit is configured to select, based on a Mahalanobis distance between groups each composed of a plurality of spectral data items or a spectral shape difference between groups each composed of a plurality of spectral data items, a plurality of machine-learning spectral components from among the plurality of spectral components of the plurality of spectral data items. The classifier generating unit is configured to perform machine learning by using the plurality of machine-learning spectral components selected by the spectral component selecting unit and generate a classifier that classifies a spectral data item.",
