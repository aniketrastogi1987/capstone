  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the disclosed invention generate an audio playlist of audio files corresponding to textual content items of a digital magazine for playing back the digital magazine. A user interacts with content items on pages of a digital magazine, such as reading a textual content item displayed on a page of the digital magazine. Upon detecting a request from the user for audio files of textual files (e.g., news articles) displayed on the digital magazine, e.g., clicking a “play” button displayed on the page, the textual files corresponding to the requested audio files are searched for in a digital magazine server, and are converted to audio files by a synthesizer of the digital magazine server, or by a synthesizer external to the digital magazine server, to generate an audio playlist for the requested audio files. The generated playlist is presented to the user in response to his/her request, allowing the user to play the audio playlist in a musical application (e.g., a media player). In one aspect, the user is able to listen to the audio files on the playlist within the digital magazine application, e.g., via the musical application running on the user's client device. In another approach, the user can listen to the audio files on the playlist via an external device (e.g., an external audio headset), while navigating away from the digital magazine application, e.g., interacting with other applications running on his/her client device.",

  "abstract": "A system converts a readable digital magazine into an audible digital magazine by generating an audio playlist of audio files corresponding to textual content items of the digital magazine. The system monitors a user's interactions with content items on a page of the digital magazine, where the content items include textual content items. Upon detecting a request from the user for audio files corresponding to the textual content items, the requested audio files are searched and retrieved. In response to not finding the requested audio files ready for playback, the textual content items are obtained and converted into the requested audio files. An audio playlist of the requested audio files is generated for presentation to the user of the digital magazine in response to the request.",
