A computer implemented system includes a non-transitory memory storage comprising instructions and one or more processors in communication with the memory, wherein the one or more processors execute the instructions to obtain, via the one or more processors at a programmed computer, data comprising multiple variables corresponding to multiple samples in a very large dataset, define, via the one or more processors, multiple sets of variables occurring in the samples comprising a set of x variables and a set of y variables, where the intersection of the sets is zero, for each set of variables, determine, via the one or more processors, a support for each set and a union of each set, determine, via the one or more processors, an interest for each of the multiple association rules of the sets of variables, and determine, via the one or more processors, a chi squared interest, (χ 2 interest), for each association to identify related sets of variables, including almost exclusive relationships. A non-transitory computer readable media storing computer instructions that when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the steps of obtaining, via the on...",
