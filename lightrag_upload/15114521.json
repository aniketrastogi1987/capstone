  "abstract": "Some aspects of this specification describe the use of Boolean algebra for patent claim mapping and analysis. In some instances, characteristics of a collection of technologies are represented as binary variables, and each of the technologies has a respective subset of the characteristics. The collection of technologies is represented as a collection of binary functions, and each binary function includes a respective subset of the binary variables. A patent claim is generated based on inverting the binary functions according to Boolean algebra.",
