  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The invention offers a solution to the above mentioned problems, by proposing a method for programming an artificial neuron network, wherein a single resistive random-access memory is used per artificial synapse, whilst using at most only two types of electrical programming pulses. One aspect of the invention relates to a method for programming an artificial neuron network which has a plurality of artificial synapses, each artificial synapse being a single resistive random-access memory, such as a OxRAM or CBRAM memory, in series with means of current limitation, with the resistive random-access memory comprising an active zone and first and second electrodes on either side of the active zone, the programming method comprising the following steps: a step for determining the number N of conductance intervals, where N is a non-negative integer equal to or greater than three; for each resistive random-access memory: a step for choosing a conductance interval from amongst the N previously determined conductance intervals; a step i) comprising: a first sub-step for application of a voltage pulse of a first type between the first and second electrodes of said resistive random-access memory, the voltage pulse of the first type having a first duration and a first amplitude, and a second sub-step for reading a conductance value of said resistive random-access memory; if said conductance value does not belong to the previously chosen conductance interval, a step ii), comprising; a first sub-step for application of a voltage pulse of a second type between the first and second electrodes of said resistive random-access memory, the voltage pulse of the second type having a second duration and a second amplitude, and a second sub-step for reading a conductance value of said resistive random-access memory; if said conductance value does not belong to the chosen conductance interval, a step according to which step i) is reiterated, steps i) and i...",
