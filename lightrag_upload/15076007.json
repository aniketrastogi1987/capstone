In other embodiments of the inventive subject matter, a system comprises a processor and a memory coupled to the processor and comprising computer readable program code embodied in the memory that is executable by the processor to perform: receiving a document containing subject matter related to a course of action, the document comprising a plurality of sub-documents that are related to one another in a time sequence, converting the document to a vector format to generate a vectorized document that encodes a probability distribution of words in the document and transition probabilities between words, applying a machine learning algorithm to the vectorized document to generate an estimated vectorized document, associating the estimated vectorized document with a reference document, predicting future subject matter contained in a future sub-document of the document based on the reference document, adjusting the course of action by determining a destination for communication of the document based on the future subject matter that was predicted, and electronically communicating the document to the d...",
