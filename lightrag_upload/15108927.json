According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for detecting malicious code in an intelligent terminal, comprising: acquiring a virtual machine executable file of an application from an application layer of an intelligent terminal operating system; decompiling the virtual machine executable file to obtain a decompiled function information structure; parsing the decompiled function information structure, and extracting a function calling sequence in the decompiled function information structure; matching the function calling sequence using a preset malicious code feature library; if matching succeeds, determining that the virtual machine executable file of the application contains malicious code. Preferably, the method further comprises: by parsing the decompiled function information structure, obtaining a virtual machine mnemonic sequence; and extracting the function calling sequence from the virtual machine mnemonic sequence. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a device for detecting malicious code in an intelligent terminal, comprising: a file acquiring unit configured to acquire a virtual machine executable file of an application from an application layer of an intelligent terminal operating system; a decompiling unit configured to decompile the virtual machine executable file to obtain a decompiled function information structure; an extracting unit configured to parse the decompiled function information structure, and extract a function calling sequence in the decompiled function information structure; a detecting unit configured to match the function calling sequence using a preset malicious code feature library; and if matching succeeds, determine that the ...",

The method comprises: acquiring a virtual machine executable file of an application from an application layer of an intelligent terminal operating system; decompiling the virtual machine executable file to obtain a decompiled function information structure; parsing the decompiled function information structure to extract a function calling sequence in the decompiled function information structure; matching the function calling sequence using a preset malicious code feature library; if matching succeeds, determining that the virtual machine executable file of the application contains malicious code. By applying the solution of the present invention, through a virtual machine executable file of the application, it may be analyzed and determined whether the application comprises malicious code, such that a tampered application program or a malicious software may be detected and rem...",
