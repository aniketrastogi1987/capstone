A user sentiment associated with a system response provided by the dialog system as part of the chat flow is determined based on observation of the user. A next system response is rerouted from a planned sequence of the chat flow to a sentiment-based repair sequence to alter content delivered to the user based on a detected aspect of the user sentiment.",
