  "abstract": "An electronic neural core circuit is provided, comprising a processor, and a memory. The memory comprises a plurality of neural compartments, each compartment comprising a first state variable representing a first state of the neural compartment, and a second state variable representing a second state of the neural compartment. The processor is configured to, for a first neural compartment: receive a synaptic input, perform first and second state variable operations, join operations utilizing input from state variables from another compartment that has been previously processed, thereby producing a join operation results, and produce a state variable output.",
