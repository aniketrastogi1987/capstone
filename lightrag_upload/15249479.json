  "abstract": "An electronic device coupling system includes a plurality of electronic devices inserted together; a public device coupled to one of the plurality of electronic devices and including a display module, an audio module, and a control module; a master device including the public device and the one of the plurality of electronic device; and at least one slave devices including other electronic devices. The master device further includes a function module and is coupleable to any one of the at least one slave devices. When one of the at least one slave devices is coupled to the master device, the control module controls the one of the at least one slave devices via the function module.",
