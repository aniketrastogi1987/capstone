  "abstract": "System and methods for machine learning are described. A first input value is obtained. A second input value is also obtained. A decision to use for generating a cycle output is selected based on a randomness factor. The decision is at least one of a random decision or a best decision from a previous cycle. A cycle output for the first and second inputs is generated using the selected decision. The selected decision and the resulting cycle output are stored.",

FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating one example of a traditional neuron. FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating one example of a decision making neuron in accordance with the described systems and methods. FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating one example of a decision making module. FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an example of a neural network module. FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating one example of a network of decision making neurons that are each associated with a unique input value combination where each input value combination is distinct. FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating another example of a network of decision making neurons that are each associated with a unique input value combination and some of the input value combinations are linear while others are distinct. FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of a method for machine learning. FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of a method for machine learning. FIG. 10 is a flow diagram of a method for machine learning. FIG. 11 depicts a block diagram of a computer system suitable for implementing the present systems and methods. detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?",
