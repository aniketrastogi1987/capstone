  "abstract": "Embodiments of a system and method for identifying and prioritizing company prospects by training at least one classifier on client company win/loss metrics. One or more classifiers can be trained on a training database compiled from company win/loss database for a client and firmographic data from a robust business entity database. Once trained, the system can employ Artificial Intelligence powered by the trained classifiers to classify and output customized prospect lists of thousands of profiled and scored companies that the AI has determined are likely targets for specific marketing and sales. The AI can also ingest databases of client targets and classify and score them based on the custom-trained classifier.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In at least one embodiment, described is a system comprising: a transceiver for communicating over a network; a memory for storing at least instructions; a processor device that is operative to execute program instructions; a training database comprising a list of company engagements, and, for each engagement, a company identifier, wherein the list comprises won company engagements, and company entity data mapped to each company, the company entity data comprising firmographic data from a business entity information database; a classification engine comprising at least one classifier configured to identify company prospects, the classification engine being configured to train the classifier on the training data in the training database to identify one or more attractive classes and one or more unattractive classes to classify company prospects. In at least one of the various embodiments, the company engagements can comprise a list of customers. In at least one of the various embodiments, the list of company engagements can comprise, for at least one of the engagements, a begin time for when the company became a customer. In at least one of the various embodiments, the list of company engagements can comprise, for at least one of the engagements, a customer revenue value. In at least one of the various embodiments, the list of won company engagements can comprise a sale of a product or service In at least one of the various embodiments, the list of won company engagements can comprise a response to a marketing message. In at least one of the various embodiments, the training database can comprise a list of lost company engagements. In at least one of the various embodiments, the list of company engagements can comprise one or more employee identifiers. In at least one of the various embodiments, the list of lost company engagements can comprise, for at least one lost company engagement, a when lost value and a why lost value. In at least one of the...",
