  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A framework for performing aspect-based sentiment analysis is described herein. In accordance with one aspect of the framework, initial word embeddings are generated from a training dataset. A predictive model is trained using the initial word embeddings to obtain high-level representations of relations between aspect terms and opinion terms in review sentences. The trained predictive model may then be used to recognize one or more sequences of tokens in a current dataset. With these and other advantages and features that will become hereinafter apparent, further information may be obtained by reference to the following detailed description and appended claims, and to the figures attached hereto.",
