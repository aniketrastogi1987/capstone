  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An embodiment provides an occurrence-data retrieval system. The system includes a data storage operable to store a plurality of instances of occurrence-data, each instance of the occurrence-data having a representative feature, a central computing device operable to communicate with the data storage, and instructions that cause a computing device to perform steps. The steps include receive from an input-selector an input selection corresponding to a target-occurrence having a representative feature, and select a pattern recognition criteria corresponding to the representative feature of the target-occurrence. The steps also include automatically search the plurality of instances of stored occurrence-data for data correlating to the target-occurrence using the selected pattern recognition criteria, and provide an output indicative of a result of the automatic search. The input-selector may include an individual user. The pattern recognition criteria may be automatically selected in response to input selection corresponding to the target-occurrence. The input selection may further include a representative feature of the target-occurrence. The representative feature may include a time period. The representative feature may include acoustic frequency components. The representative feature may include a frequency pattern. The frequency pattern may include at least one selected from a group consisting of a recognized word, a set of words, a breaking glass, a dog bark, a door opening, an alarm, a threshold acoustic level, and a voiceprint. The representative feature may include an electromagnetic pattern. The electromagnetic pattern may include at least one selected from a group consisting of a visible light, an infrared light, an ultraviolet light, and a radar. The recognition criteria may be automatically selected in response to the selected representative feature. The automatic search instruction may include using the pattern recognition criteria sele...",
