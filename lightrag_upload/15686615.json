  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In general, this specification describes a special-purpose hardware circuit that computes neural network inferences. In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a circuit for performing neural network computations for a neural network comprising a plurality of neural network layers, the circuit comprising: a matrix computation unit configured to, for each of the plurality of neural network layers: receive a plurality of weight inputs and a plurality of activation inputs for the neural network layer, and generate a plurality of accumulated values based on the plurality of weight inputs and the plurality of activation inputs; and a vector computation unit communicatively coupled to the matrix computation unit and configured to, for each of the plurality of neural network layers: apply an activation function to each accumulated value generated by the matrix computation unit to generate a plurality of activated values for the neural network layer. Implementations can include one or more of the following features. A unified buffer communicatively coupled to the matrix computation unit and the vector computation unit, where the unified buffer is configured to receive and store output from the vector computation unit, and the unified buffer is configured to send the received output as input to the matrix computation unit. A sequencer configured to receive instructions from a host device and generate a plurality of control signals from the instructions, where the plurality of control signals control dataflow through the circuit; and a direct memory access engine communicatively coupled to the unified buffer and the sequencer, where the direct memory access engine is configured to send the plurality of activation inputs to the unified buffer, where the unified buffer is configured to send the plurality of activation inputs to the matrix computation unit, and where the direct memory access engin...",
