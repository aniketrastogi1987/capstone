  "abstract": "A system that incorporates teachings of the present disclosure may include, for example, a synthesis engine having a controller, and a storage medium for storing instructions to be executed by the controller. The instructions, when executed by the controller, can cause the controller to retrieve collected information associated with a behavior of an individual, synthesize from the information a measure of a mood of the individual to interact with others, and transmit the measure to a system associated with the individual to manage requests between the individual and the entity. The measure of the mood of the individual can indicate an availability of the individual and a receptiveness of the individual to accept a request to interact with an entity. The measure can be described by a plurality of dimensions. Other embodiments are disclosed.",
