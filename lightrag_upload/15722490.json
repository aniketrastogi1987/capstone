  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In a first aspect, the present invention concerns a method for secure learning of the parameters of a convolution neural network CNN, for data classification; the method comprising the implementation, by data processing means of a first server, of steps of: (a0) Receiving from a second server a base of already classified learning data, said learning data being homomorphically encrypted; (a1) Learning in the encrypted domain, from said learning database, the parameters of a reference CNN comprising at least: a non-linear layer operating an at least two-degree polynomial function approximating an activation function; a batch normalization layer before each non-linear layer; (a2) Transmitting the learnt parameters to said second server, for decryption and use for classification. According to a first variant of a second aspect, the present invention concerns a method for secure input data classification, characterized in that it comprises the implementation of steps of: (a) Learning, by data processing means of a first server from a base of already classified learning data, the parameters of a reference convolution neural network CNN comprising at least: a non-linear layer operating an at least two-degree polynomial function approximating an activation function; a batch normalization layer before each non-linear layer; (b) Receiving said input, homomorphically encrypted, by data processing means of a second server, from client equipment; (c) Classifying said encrypted input in the encrypted domain, by data processing means of the second server, by means of the reference CNN; (d) Transmitting the encryption of the classification obtained to said client equipment, for decryption. According to other advantageous, non-limiting characteristics: step (a) is implemented in accordance with the secure learning method of the first aspect; said polynomial function approximating an activation function is determined before learning via polynomial ...",
