  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>One or more embodiments described herein provide benefits and solve one or more of the foregoing or other problems in the art with electronic messaging systems and methods. For example, the disclosed electronic messaging system provides a greater sense of another user's presence and activity within a messaging application by providing users dynamic message composition indicators. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the system detects attributes of messages being composed between a first user and a second user within a messaging conversation (e.g., a communication thread), and provides visual indications of the detected attributes and changes in messages as they are composed (e.g., by way of graphical message composition indicators). Specifically, in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein, a system determines that a first user is composing a message to a second user using a first client device. The system then provides a message composition indicator to the second user by way of a second client device to indicate to the second user that the first user is composing the message. The system then detects (e.g., based on one or more actions of the first user on the first client device) an increase in size of the message being composed by the first user. In response to the detected increase in size of the message, the system causes the message composition indicator to dynamically increase in size (e.g., as displayed on the second client device). In one or more embodiments, the message composition indicator includes a graphical bar (e.g., a progress bar) that increases in size with the growth of the message as the sender composes it. Thus, the system can provide real-time updates to a recipient as a sender composes a message and the recipient need not wonder regarding an unknown status of the message composition. Additional features and advantages of the present application will be set forth in the description which follows, and ...",
