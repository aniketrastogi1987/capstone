  "abstract": "The present disclosure provides systems and methods that use machine learning to improve whole-structure relevance of hierarchical informational displays. In particular, the present disclosure provides systems and methods that employ a supervised, discriminative machine learning approach to jointly optimize the ranking of items and their display attributes. One example system includes a machine-learned display selection model that has been trained to jointly select a plurality of items and one or more attributes for each item for inclusion in an informational display. For example, the machine-learned display selection model can optimize a nested submodular objective function to jointly select the items and attributes.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Aspects and advantages of embodiments of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or can be learned from the description, or can be learned through practice of the embodiments. One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computing system to select information for inclusion in informational displays. The computing system includes a machine-learned display selection model that has been trained to simultaneously and jointly select a plurality of items and one or more attributes for each item for inclusion in an informational display. The computing system includes one or more processors and one or more non-transitory computer-readable media that collectively store instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the computing system to perform operations. The instructions cause the computing system to obtain a plurality of candidate items that are candidates for inclusion in the informational display. A plurality of candidate attributes are associated with each of the plurality of candidate items. The instructions cause the computing system to determine a plurality of features for each of the plurality of candidate items or the candidate attributes for each candidate item. The instructions cause the computing system to input at least a portion of the plurality of features, the plurality of candidate items, and the plurality of candidate attributes for each item into the machine-learned display selection model. The instructions cause the computing system to receive, as an output of the machine-learned display selection model, a single joint selection that specifies both the plurality of items and the one or more attributes for each item for inclusion in the informational display. Another example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method to select information for display. The method includes identifying, by the one or more computing devices, ...",
