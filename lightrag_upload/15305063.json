  "abstract": "A solar power panel failure search and detect system to search and detect malfunctioning or failed sites of a solar power panel. A search unit is installed in a remotely controllable aerial vehicle. The search unit maintains a constant distance between a solar panel and a failure detector, and maintains the failure detector at an optimum angle. A control unit controls a flight path and a flight angle of the aerial vehicle and controls/regulates an angle of the failure detector, a receiver, a processor, and the search unit. The search unit has an angle sensor, the failure detector, an angle adjuster and an imaging device. The control unit has a transmitter to transmit the search result data.",
