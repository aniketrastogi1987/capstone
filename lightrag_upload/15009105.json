  "abstract": "A system for motion analytics includes acceleration sensors and selectively infrared sensors or microphones. The system also includes a processor and display device. The processor identifies test scores obtained by subjects. The processor also computes degrees of similarities in the real-time physical movements between the at least two groups of subjects using the acceleration sensors, and an amount of time during which some subjects among the at least two groups of subject are engaged in communication using the infrared sensors and/or the microphones. Further, the processor analyzes a correlation between the test scores and the degrees of similarities, and between the test scores and the amount of communication time. The processor then predicts an improvement in the test scores based on patterns in the analysis of the correlation. The predicted improvement of the test scores is then displayed on the display device.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In the abovementioned Non-patent Documents 1 and 2, an investigation is made of relationship between home environment and scholastic performance, based on a questionnaire survey. Thus, it is difficult to remove ambiguity included in survey results and conduct a timely survey along with a change in educational environment and what is presented is just a qualitative tendency. In the abovementioned Non-patent Document 3, various arguments are made about class size effects including an argument that questions its effect. This means that it is not assured that control of class size by school operators leads to improvement in scholastic performance. In the abovementioned Non-patent Document 4, descriptions are provided about classmate effects (peer effects) in which a student in a class with more classmates who make a fine record becomes to make a fine record and, in countries, it is reported that classmates have a certain effect. However, its mechanism is not clarified well and designing classes is performed based on school operator's experience. In fact, in previously conducted studies on factors which relate to improvement in scholastic performance, several candidates of qualitative factors are specified, but they are not useful as a sufficient criterion for decision-making for school operators to design a policy for improving scholastic performance based on a quantitative decision. In other words, factors having influence on scholastic performance which can be controlled by school operators are not found. This is due to the following reasons: indicators for evaluating quantitative effects are not developed; and it is difficult to collect data in quantity and quality required to develop the indicators for evaluating quantitative effects and such data does not exist. On the other hand, in the abovementioned Non-patent Document 5, it is possible to accumulate large amounts of data reflecting human behaviors using sensor technology, mobile phones, and s...",
