  "abstract": "Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage media, for training a neural network using normalized target outputs. One of the methods includes updating current values of the normalization parameters to account for the target output for the training item; determining a normalized target output for the training item by normalizing the target output for the training item in accordance with the updated normalization parameter values; processing the training item using the neural network to generate a normalized output for the training item in accordance with current values of main parameters of the neural network; determining an error for the training item using the normalized target output and the normalized output; and using the error to adjust the current values of the main parameters of the neural network.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods for training a neural network using normalized target outputs. Other implementations of this and other aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices. A system of one or more computers can be so configured by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be so configured by virtue of having instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions. Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. By adaptively rescaling the target outputs during training, the neural network can be effectively trained even if magnitudes of target outputs change during the training. In particular, adaptively rescaling target outputs in the manner described in this specification can be beneficial when a single algorithm is being applied to solve multiple problems, i.e., to train the neural network to perform multiple different tasks. As another example, adaptively rescaling outputs during training allows the natural magnitude of each output to be disentangled from the importance assigned to it in the loss function. This is particularly useful when the outputs are in different units, e.g., when the neural network is simultaneously predicting many signals of an agent with multi-modal sensors. As yet another example, adaptive scaling can help in problems that are non-stationary, such as in reinforcement learning where the policy of behavior is often learned along with a value function and therefore the distribution and magnitudes of the targets can change unexpect...",
