  "abstract": "A computer-implemented method for knowledge based ontology editing, is provided. The method receives a language instance to update a knowledge base, using a computer. The method semantically parses the language instance to detect an ontology for editing. The method maps one or more nodes for the ontology for editing based on an ontology database and the knowledge base. The method determines whether the mapped nodes are defined or undefined within the knowledge base. The method calculates a first confidence score based on a number of the defined and undefined mapped nodes. Furthermore, the method updates the knowledge base when the first confidence score meets a pre-defined threshold.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present disclosure implements a system, method, and computer program product for natural language and knowledge based editing. In an embodiment, a method for a knowledge based ontology editor, is provided. The method includes receiving a language instance, on a computer, in order to update a knowledge base communicating with the computer. The method includes semantically parsing the language instance in order to detect an ontology to be edited. The method includes mapping the ontology for editing based on an ontology database and the knowledge base. The method includes determining whether the mapped nodes are defined within the knowledge base. The method includes assigning a first confidence score to the ontology based on defined nodes and updating the knowledge base when the first confidence score satisfies a pre-defined threshold. In another embodiment, a computer system for natural language and knowledge based editing is provided. The computer system includes receiving a language instance, on a computer, in order to update a knowledge base communicating with the computer. The computer system includes semantically parsing the language instance in order to detect an ontology for editing. The computer system includes mapping the ontology for editing based on an ontology database and the knowledge base.
