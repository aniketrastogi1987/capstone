  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The specification overcomes the deficiencies and limitations of the approaches described in the background section at least in part by providing novel technology for integrative cognition of driver behavior using a deep neuron network and associated hierarchical temporal memory. According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, a method may include receiving, at one or more computing devices, signal data from one or more sensors, the one or more computing devices being electronically communicatively coupled to the one or more sensors to receive the signal data; inputting the signal data into an input layer of a deep neural network (DNN), the DNN including one or more layers; generating, using the one or more layers of the DNN, one or more spatial representations of the signal data; generating, using one or more hierarchical temporal memories (HTMs) respectively associated with the one or more layers of the DNNs, one or more temporal predictions by the DNN based on the one or more spatial representations; and generating an anticipation of a future outcome by recognizing a temporal pattern based on the one or more temporal predictions. According to another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclose, the system includes one or more sensors providing sensor data; one or more non-transitory computer memories for storing and providing access to data; one or more computer processors coupled to the non-transitory computer memories to store and receive data; a deep neural network (DNN) storable by the one or more non-transitory computer memories and executable by the one or more computer processors, the DNN including a plurality of hierarchical layers, the plurality of hierarchical layers including an input layer, one or more intermediate layers, and a recognition layer, the input layer of the DNN receiving sensor data from the one or more sensors; and a deep neural network (DNN) storable by the ...",
