  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>One embodiment provides a system comprising a memory device for maintaining deterministic neural data relating to a digital neuron and a logic circuit for deterministic neural computation and stochastic neural computation. Deterministic neural computation comprises processing a neuronal state of the neuron based on the deterministic neural data maintained. Stochastic neural computation, wherein stochastic neural computation comprises generating stochastic neural data relating to the neuron and processing the neuronal state of the neuron based on the stochastic neural data generated. Another embodiment provides a method comprising maintaining deterministic neural data relating to a neuron for deterministic neural computation, generating stochastic neural data relating to the neuron for stochastic neural computation, and processing a neuronal state of the neuron based on one of the deterministic neural data maintained and the stochastic neural data generated. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become understood with reference to the following description, appended claims and accompanying figures.",
