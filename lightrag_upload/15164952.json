  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In some embodiments, a computer-implemented method for providing information selected from a large set of digital content to at least one user is disclosed. The method comprises receiving user context information associated with the at least one user; identifying or generating, using at least one processor executing stored program instructions, a first concept in a semantic network, the first concept representing at least a portion of the user context information; obtaining at least one concept, including a second concept, semantically relevant to the first concept at least in part, by synthesizing the second concept based on the first concept and at least one other concept in the semantic network; and providing information to the at least one user, wherein the information is selected by using the first concept and the at least one obtained concept semantically relevant to the first concept, wherein the first concept in the semantic network is represented by a data structure storing data associated with a node in the semantic network. In some embodiments, a system for providing information selected from a large set of digital content to at least one user is disclosed. The system comprises at least one processor configured to perform a method comprising receiving user context information associated with the at least one user; identifying or generating a first concept in a semantic network, the first concept representing at least a portion of the user context information; obtaining at least one concept, including a second concept, semantically relevant to the first concept at least in part, by synthesizing the second concept based on the first concept and at least one other concept in the semantic network; and providing information to the at least one user, wherein the information is selected by using the first concept and the at least one obtained concept semantically relevant to the first concept, wherein the first concept in the semantic network ...",
