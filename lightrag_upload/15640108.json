  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Among the embodiments disclosed herein are quantum circuits (and associated compilation techniques) for performing Shor's quantum algorithm to factor n-bit integers. Example embodiments of the circuits use only 2n+2 qubits. In contrast to previous space-optimized implementations, embodiments of the disclosed technology feature a purely Toffoli-based modular multiplication circuit. The circuit depth and the overall gate count are in (n 3 ) and (n 3 log n), respectively. Thus, desirable space and time costs can be achieved while using a purely classical modular multiplication circuit. This enables testing and localization of faults in both, the logical level circuit and an actual quantum hardware implementation. Also, embodiments of the disclosed approach evade most of the cost overheads originating from rotation synthesis. For instance, certain example modular multiplication circuits disclosed herein are based on an (in-place) constant-adder that uses dirty ancilla qubits to achieve a size in (n log n) and a depth in (n). Embodiments of the disclosed technology also include techniques for implementing a quantum circuit for integer addition of a general number by a constant number that can be implemented if n/2 dirty ancilla qubits are available. Such embodiments provide improvements over alternative approaches that achieve this result either with a large number of ancillas (namely, n many, and they were assumed to be clean) or with a type of elementary gate that is difficult to implement fault-tolerantly, namely, rotation gates around very small angles. Further, certain embodiments use so-called Toffoli gates without resort to more complex quantum gates. In general, Toffoli gates are easier to implement fault-tolerantly. In particular implementations, a circuit for performing Shor's algorithm can constructed using the disclosed technology using only 2n+2 qubits to factor an n-bit number. Such implementations can comprise, for example, (n 3 log n) T...",
