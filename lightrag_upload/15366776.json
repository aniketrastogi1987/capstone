  "abstract": "A computer-implemented method assigns one or more trophies to a user. A game is emulated in response to a request from a client device. A trophy trigger is detected during emulation of the game by comparing a current program counter value to a predetermined value and comparing a stored instruction in an instruction storage location to a predetermined instruction when the current program counter value matches the predetermined counter value. The one or more trophies are assigned to a user account that is associated with the user when the current program counter value matches the predetermined value and the instruction in the instruction storage location matches the predetermined instruction.",
