  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Aspects of the present invention is generally directed to a technique that processes a photographic image more appropriately, according to a posture of a portable terminal when an imaging object is imaged. According to an aspect of the present invention, an information processing apparatus includes an acquisition unit configured to acquire posture information of an imaging unit, an extraction unit configured to extract characteristic amount information of an image imaged by the imaging unit, an identification unit configured to identify a subject included in the image imaged by the imaging unit using the posture information acquired by the acquisition unit and the characteristic amount information extracted by the extraction unit, a recognition unit configured to recognize a subject area in the image in a recognition mode according to the subject identified by the identification unit, and a correction unit configured to correct the image including the subject area by clipping, from the image the subject area recognized by the recognition unit. Further features of aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.",
