  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In some embodiments, a method for addition of content to a question answer (QA) system may be provided. The method may comprise retrieving, from a template store of the QA system, a template comprising one or more data fields and one or more metadata fields. The method may further comprise populating a passage field with passage information, wherein the passage field is one of the one or more data fields. The method may further comprise populating a training field with training information, wherein the training field is one of the one or more metadata fields. The method may further comprise ingesting, into a corpus of the QA system, a completed template comprising a populated passage field and a populated training field into the corpus. In some embodiments, a question answer (QA) system is provided comprising a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory, the processor configured to: retrieve, from a template store of the QA system, a template comprising one or more data fields and one or more metadata fields; populate a passage field with passage information, wherein the passage field is one of the one or more data fields; populate a training field with training information, wherein the training field is one of the one or more metadata fields; and ingest, into a corpus of the QA system, a completed template comprising a populated passage field and a populated training field into the corpus. In some embodiments, a computer program product for addition of content to a question answer (QA) system is provided, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a processor to cause the processor to: retrieve, from a template store of the QA system, a template comprising one or more data fields and one or more metadata fields; populate a passage field with passage information, wherein the passage field is one of the one or more data fields; ...",
