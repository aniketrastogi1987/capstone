  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Advertising on the net is very dynamic from videos to banner images to text based ads. Videos can be streamed from servers on the server side allowing full motion to be shown on the client but this needs a specialized client. GIF images allow motion to be shown through multiple images within a single image. Banner images use these GIF images to show some exciting content. This invention describes using a client device and a server device to create streaming ads on the client device using a timing mechanism. Said timing mechanism allows selected target areas on the client display to be updated at regular intervals to create a visual perception of motion.",
