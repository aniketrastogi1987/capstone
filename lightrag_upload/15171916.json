  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>According to an aspect of the present invention, a measurement apparatus that measures a shape of an object includes a projection unit configured to project, onto the object, pattern light including a plurality of lines on which identification portions for identifying the respective lines are arranged, an imaging unit configured to capture an image of the object having the pattern light projected thereon, and a processing unit configured to obtain information on the shape of the object based on the image, wherein the processing unit obtains the information on the shape of the object by setting a plurality of detection lines in one line of the plurality of lines based on a luminance distribution of the image in a direction intersecting with the plurality of lines, detecting a position of the identification portion based on a luminance distribution of the image in the plurality of detection lines, and identifying the respective plurality of lines using the detected position of the identification portion. Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.",
