  "abstract": "Apparatus and method for a scalable, free running neuromorphic processor. For example, one embodiment of a neuromorphic processing apparatus comprises: a plurality of neurons; an interconnection network to communicatively couple at least a subset of the plurality of neurons; a spike controller to stochastically generate a trigger signal, the trigger signal to cause a selected neuron to perform a thresholding operation to determine whether to issue a spike signal.",
