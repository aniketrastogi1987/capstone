  "abstract": "In an approach for providing a self-learning framework for performance analysis using content-oriented analysis, a processor initiates a performance analysis of a dump on a thread. A processor presents time information and an associated location of the time information. A processor analyzes the time information by registering the time information into a knowledge base to debug errors in a computer program. Subsequent to a query for dump information, a processor displays the analyzed time information, based on the performance analysis.",
