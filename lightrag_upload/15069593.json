  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and it does not identify key/critical elements of the invention or delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. User interface control using a keyboard is described. In an embodiment, a user interface displayed on a display device is controlled using a computer connected to a keyboard. The keyboard has a plurality of alphanumeric keys that can be used for text entry. The computer receives data comprising a sequence of key-presses from the keyboard, and generates for each key-press a physical location on the keyboard. The relative physical locations of the key-presses are compared to calculate a movement path over the keyboard. The movement path describes the path of a user's digit over the keyboard. The movement path is mapped to a sequence of coordinates in the user interface, and the movement of an object displayed in the user interface is controlled in accordance with the sequence of coordinates. Many of the attendant features will be more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.",
