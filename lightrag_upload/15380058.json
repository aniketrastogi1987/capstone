  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Methods, systems, and computer readable media for a data-driven demand response (DR) recommender are disclosed. One system includes a processor and a memory. The system is configured to receive historical electricity usage information and historical weather information associated with at least one building, to generate at least one regression tree for predicting values associated with demand response (DR) related to the at least one building. The subject matter described herein may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. As such, the terms “function” or “node” as used herein refer to hardware, which may also include software and/or firmware components, for implementing the feature(s) being described. In some exemplary implementations, the subject matter described herein may be implemented using a computer readable medium having stored thereon computer executable instructions that when executed by the processor of a computer control the computer to perform steps. Exemplary computer readable media suitable for implementing the subject matter described herein include non-transitory computer readable media, such as disk memory devices, chip memory devices, programmable logic devices, and application specific integrated circuits. In addition, a computer readable medium that implements the subject matter described herein may be located on a single device or computing platform or may be distributed across multiple devices or computing platforms.",
