  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The present invention improves the RELR machine learning in the general case of ordinal target outcomes. This includes how to select very parsimonious features in this machine learning in what is here called Explicit RELR feature selection to differentiate it from the implicit feature reduction/selection taught in the U.S. Pat. No. 8,032,473. This also includes how to handle perfectly positive or negative correlations between predictive features and the target outcome in the learning.",
