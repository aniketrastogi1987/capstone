  "abstract": "Performance information and configuration information is received for the plurality of computer systems. The computer systems are grouped into a plurality of clusters based at least in part on the performance information, where the plurality of clusters includes a first cluster and a second cluster. A system configuration associated with the first cluster is automatically identified from the configuration information and is automatically sent to the second cluster.",
