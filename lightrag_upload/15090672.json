  "abstract": "A neural network unit. A register holds an indicator that specifies narrow and wide configurations. A first memory holds rows of 2N/N narrow/wide weight words in the narrow/wide configuration. A second memory holds rows of 2N/N narrow/wide data words in the narrow/wide configuration. An array of neural processing units (NPU) is configured as 2N/N narrow/wide NPUs and to receive the 2N/N narrow/wide weight words of rows from the first memory and to receive the 2N/N narrow/wide data words of rows from the second memory in the narrow/wide configuration. In the narrow configuration, the 2N NPUs perform narrow arithmetic operations on the 2N narrow weight words and the 2N narrow data words received from the first and second memories. In the wide configuration, the N NPUs perform wide arithmetic operations on the N wide weight words and the N wide data words received from the first and second memories.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a processor that includes a neural network unit (NNU). FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a NPU of FIG. 1 . FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the arrangement of the N mux-regs of the N NPUs of the NNU of FIG. 1 to illustrate their operation as an N-word rotater, or circular shifter, for a row of data words received from the data RAM of FIG. 1 . FIG. 4 is a table illustrating a program for storage in the program memory of and execution by the NNU of FIG. 1 . FIG. 5 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 4 by the NNU. FIG. 6A is a block diagram illustrating the NNU of FIG. 1 to execute the program of FIG. 4 . FIG. 6B is a flowchart illustrating operation of the processor of FIG. 1 to perform an architectural program that uses the NNU to perform multiply-accumulate-activation function computations classically associated with neurons of hidden layers of an artificial neural network such as performed by the program of FIG. 4 . FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating a NPU of FIG. 1 according to an alternate embodiment. FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a NPU of FIG. 1 according to an alternate embodiment. FIG. 9 is a table illustrating a program for storage in the program memory of and execution by the NNU of FIG. 1 . FIG. 10 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 9 by the NNU. FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the NNU of FIG. 1 is shown. In the embodiment of FIG. 11 , a neuron is split into two portions, the activation function unit portion and the ALU portion (which also includes the shift register portion), and each activation function unit portion is shared by multiple ALU portions. FIG. 12 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 4 by the NNU of FIG. 11 . FIG. 13 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 4 by the N...",
