  "abstract": "Methods, computer program products, and systems are presented. The methods include, for instance: determining a category of a domain having content documents and gathering search terms frequently used in similar domains associated with the category. A ground truth table has domain search results as discovered from searches by use of the search terms from the similar domains. Ground truths are utilized in later searches for optimal search results.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome, and additional advantages are provided, through the provision, in one aspect, of a method. The method for building a ground truth table includes, for example: determining, by one or more processor of a computer, a category of a domain having content documents; selecting one or more similar domains associated with the category of the domain; identifying one or more search terms frequently used in the similar domains; performing a first domain search in the domain by use of a first search term of the one or more search terms from the identifying; adding, to a ground truth table, a first ground truth as generated based on a first result corresponding to the first domain search; and producing the ground truth table for later searches of the domain such that the later searches may be optimally performed by use of the ground truth table. Additional features are realized through the techniques set forth herein. Other embodiments and aspects, including but not limited to computer program product and system, are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention.",
