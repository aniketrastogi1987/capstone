  "abstract": "A method for determining specific conditions occurring on industrial equipment based upon received signal data from sensors attached to the industrial equipment is provided. Using a server computer system, signal data is received and aggregated into feature vectors. Feature vectors represent a set of signal data over a particular range of time. The feature vectors are clustered into subsets of feature vectors based upon attributes the feature vectors. One or more sample episodes are received, where a sample episode includes sample feature vectors and specific classification labels assigned to the sample feature vectors. A signal data model is created that includes the associated feature vectors, clusters, and assigned classification labels. The signal data model is used to assign classification labels to newly received signal data using the mapping information for the existing feature vectors, existing clusters and associated classification labels to determine the specific conditions o...",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>In the drawings: FIG. 1 is a block diagram that depicts an arrangement for implementing a signal data processing system that receives a data stream of signal data. FIG. 2 is a flow diagram that depicts a process for generating a signal data model based upon a received data stream of signal data. FIG. 3 is a flow diagram that depicts assessing and classifying signal data received using an existing signal data model. FIG. 4 depicts an example of using mapped feature vectors-to-classification labels in a previously generated signal data model to classify a new set of feature vectors. FIG. 5 depicts an example of assessing a data stream of signal data using an existing signal data model. FIG. 6 depicts example time graphs of prediction out sent to a user for analysis and feedback. FIG. 7 illustrates an example computer system that may be configured to implement, individually or in cooperation with other computer systems, various technical steps described herein. detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?",
