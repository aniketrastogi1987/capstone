  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>According to a broad aspect, there is disclosed a quantum processor comprising a first set of qubits comprising a first plurality of substantially parallel qubits; a second set of qubits comprising N successive groups of a plurality of qubits ( 1 , 2 , . . . , N), wherein N is greater than or equal to two; wherein each group of qubits comprises a plurality of substantially parallel qubits; wherein each qubit of the first plurality of substantially parallel qubits of the first set of qubits crosses substantially perpendicularly a portion of the plurality of substantially parallel qubits of a first group of the second set of qubits; wherein each qubit of any given group of the second set of qubits crosses substantially perpendicularly a portion of the plurality of substantially parallel qubits of a successive group of the second set of qubits and a plurality of couplers, each coupler for providing a communicative coupling at a crossing of two qubits. According to an embodiment, the quantum processor is used for implementing a neural network comprising a plurality of neurons and a plurality of synapses; wherein each neuron of the plurality of neurons is associated to a qubit and each synapse of the plurality of synapses is associated to a coupler of the quantum processor. In accordance with an embodiment, there is disclosed a method for training the neural network implemented in the quantum processor, the method comprising providing initialization data for initializing the plurality of couplers and the plurality of qubits of the quantum processor; until a criterion is met: performing a quantum sampling of the quantum processor to provide first empirical means, obtaining at least one training data instance for training the neural network, performing a quantum sampling of the quantum processor; wherein no bias is assigned to the qubits of the first set of qubits of the quantum processor; wherein the couplings of the first set of ...",
