  "abstract": "A spiking neural network (SNN) includes artificial neurons interconnected by artificial synapses to model a particular network. A first neuron emits spikes to neighboring neurons to cause a wave of spikes to propagate through the SNN. Weights of a portion of the synapses are increased responsive to the wave of spikes based on a spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. A second neuron emits spike to cause a chain of spikes to propagate to the first neuron on a path based on the increase in the synaptic weights. The path is determined to represent a shortest path in the particular network from a first network node represented by the second neuron to a second network node represented by the first neuron.",
