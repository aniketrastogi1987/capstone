  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In a first embodiment, the present invention is a system and method for reducing the power required for a capacitive sensing measurement and for simplifying a sample capacitor signal offset while reducing charge injection during synchronous rectification by enabling the touch sensor to begin a measurement cycle at an arbitrary voltage rather than forcing the touch sensor to have a precise and known voltage. These and other objects, features, advantages and alternative aspects of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of the following detailed description taken in combination with the accompanying drawings.",
