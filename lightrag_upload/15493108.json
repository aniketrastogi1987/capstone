  "abstract": "Talent Artificial Intelligence Virtual Agent (“TAIVA”) performs the function of an artificial intelligence driven career coach agent. The invention may serve the human resource, talent analytics, employee engagement and independent career coach functions for enterprises and professionals. Similar to a career coach who works with talent and helps them discover better opportunities and growth, this invention uses the power of machine learning and collaborative findings to discover the opportunities. The system's capabilities range from providing suggestions on career changes, helping grow in cluster of skillsets, crowd collaborate to task level gigs, build capabilities etc. The system starts with small interactions and as it learns about the candidate and other members in the network, it will use the power of Artificial intelligence, collaborative findings and global trends to create adaptive and relevant suggestive map and progress dashboard for the candidates just like a career coach.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES <EOH>The subject invention comprises a method and apparatus for learning about talent using professional's knowledge, skill depth, environmental influencers, expertise and experience in skillset. The system starts with self-declared and/or learned candidate skillset form. Initial skillsets and other influencing parameters will be used to create initial profile of the candidate and based on professional's interaction with the system, the clustered and the machine learning algorithms (the invention) would gain substantial insight about the candidate. Invention also uses other interactions within the TAIVA system to extrapolate the findings about any particular subject/professional in question. TAIVA keeps skillsets & other influential variables at the center of the system and learns about a candidate, their teams, their company and maps all the tasks, learning incurred around skillset and creates an extensive profile which helps with connecting identical candidates, provide mentor network, find relevant jobs, find relevant content/trainings, create teams etc. The Artificial Intelligence system will be able to predict the success of team, success of mentors, next hires etc. which are some crucial findings for any business. TAIVA system also has capability to work across candidate's cluster of skillsets and provide targeted suggestions, work opportunities around those clusters. This enables TAIVA to provide crowd tasks to candidates so the experts could be connected to problems on task basis. System will get smarter with every transaction between a professional and TAIVA system.",
