  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In one embodiment, the invention relates to a system comprising: a processor; a data bus coupled to the processor; and a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium being coupled to the data bus. The computer program code interacting with a plurality of computer operations and comprising instructions executable by the processor and configured for: receiving data from a plurality of data sources, the plurality of data sources comprising a blockchain data source, the blockchain data source providing blockchain data; processing the data from the plurality of data sources, the processing the data from the plurality of data sources performing data enriching to provide enriched data; generating the cognitive session graph, the cognitive session graph being associated with a session, the cognitive session graph comprising at least some enriched data; and, associating a cognitive blockchain with the cognitive session graph. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the computer program code comprising computer executable instructions configured for: receiving data from a plurality of data sources, the plurality of data sources comprising a blockchain data source, the blockchain data source providing blockchain data; processing the data from the plurality of data sources, the processing the data from the plurality of data sources performing data enriching to provide enriched data; generating the cognitive session graph, the cognitive session graph being associated with a session, the cognitive session graph comprising at least some enriched data; and, associating a cognitive blockchain with the cognitive session graph.",
