  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>An object of the present invention is to appropriately determine a priority of participants from which opinions are to be elicited when supporting decision making including a plurality of selective elements in order to enable better decision making. In order to achieve the object described above, a first aspect of the present invention is a decision making support device that supports decision making including a plurality of selective elements, the decision making support device including: an opinion acquiring unit that acquires an expressed opinion from each of a plurality of participants with respect to each of the plurality of selective elements; and a target person determining unit that determines, with respect to a given selective element, from which participant an opinion on the selective element is to be elicited when there are a plurality of unexpressed participants who have not yet expressed opinions on the selective element. In this case, the target person determining unit respectively calculates, when assuming that each of the unexpressed participants have expressed any of expected opinions, assumed group satisfaction that is determined based on contents of decision making and contents of expression of opinions of the plurality of participants, and determines from which participant an opinion on the selective element is to be elicited in consideration of the assumed group satisfaction. In this manner, by introducing group satisfaction that is obtained based on the contents of decision making and the contents of expression of opinions and considering assumed group satisfaction when assuming that unexpressed participants have expressed opinions on a given selective element, a participant from which an opinion is to be elicited (that is, a target person) can be appropriately determined. Expected opinions with respect to a given selective element can include any of the opinions already expressed by any of the participants o...",
