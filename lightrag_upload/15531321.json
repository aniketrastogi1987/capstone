  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Disclosed herein is a computer-implemented method to improve a lithographic process for imaging a portion of a design layout onto a substrate using a lithographic projection apparatus, the method comprising: obtaining a target feature; generating a perturbed target feature from the target feature by applying a perturbation thereto; generating a set of training examples comprising the perturbed target feature and an indication as whether the perturbed target feature is deemed same as the target feature; training a learning model with the set of training examples; classifying, by a computer, features in the portion of the design layout into at least two classes: being deemed same as the target feature, and being deemed different from the target feature. Also disclosed herein is a computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable medium having information recorded thereon, wherein information comprising a target feature, one or more perturbed target feature, an indication of whether the one or more perturbed target feature is deemed same as the target feature. Further disclosed herein is a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium having information recorded thereon, wherein information comprising a target feature and a machine learning model configured to classify a feature into two classes: being deemed same as the target feature, and being deemed different from the target feature.",
