  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The objects and advantages of the present invention are secured by a system having a viewing mechanism, in which a user views one or more virtual objects in an environment or scene. The environment is viewed by the user from his or her viewpoint or vantage point. The system further employs a projection mechanism that projects or displays the environment that is viewed by the user via the viewing mechanism. There is an inside-out camera or more than one inside-out cameras with various properties that can be measured or recovered from its/their output. Then based on one or more such properties, the projection mechanism alters or modifies the one or more virtual objects in the environment viewed by the user from his/her viewpoint. In the preferred embodiment, the environment or scene viewed by the user is preferably a virtual reality. In a variation, the environment is an augmented reality. In another related variation, the environment is a mixed reality. Preferably, the property of the inside-out camera based on which the one or more virtual objects in the scene/environment are modified for the user, is the pose (position and orientation) of the user. More specifically, it is the pose of the inside-out camera employed by the user, and the inside-out camera is used in the recovery of the pose. In a related embodiment, the property is a homography. Preferably, the inside-out camera is mounted on or worn by the user. In another variation, the alteration or modification to the one or more virtual objects in the environment viewed by the user are done so as to reinforce or improve a perception of the presence of the user in a virtual reality. In a similar embodiment, the alteration or modification to the one or more virtual objects in the environment viewed by the user are done so as to reinforce/improve a perception of the presence of the one or more virtual objects in an augmented or mixed reality. In another variation, the alteration is done to correc...",

  "abstract": "The present invention discloses apparatus and methods for the viewing of a reality, and in particular a comfortable and pleasant viewing of the reality by a user. The reality is viewed by the user with a viewing mechanism that may involve optics. The reality viewed may be a virtual reality, an augmented reality or a mixed reality. A projection mechanism renders the scene for the user and modifies one or more virtual objects present in the scene. The modification performed is based on one or more properties of an inside-out camera. The modification and the associated property/properties of the inside-out camera are suitably chosen to fit an application need such as to provide a pleasant and comfortable viewing experience for the user. The inside-out camera may be attached to the viewing mechanism, which may be worn by the user. The reality viewed may be from the viewpoint of the user, or from the viewpoint of another device detached from the user.",
