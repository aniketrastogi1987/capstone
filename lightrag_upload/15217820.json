A future causation score distribution, then, may indicate a probability distribution over possible future causation scores, thereby predicting the scientific acceptance of the hypothesis at some specific date in the future.

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Examples of the disclosure are directed toward generating a causation score with respect to an agent and an outcome, and projecting a future causation score distribution. For example, a causation score may be determined with respect to a hypothesis that a given agent causes a given outcome, and the score may indicate the acceptance of that hypothesis in the scientific community, as described by scientific literature. A future causation score distribution, then, may indicate a probability distribution over possible future causation scores, thereby predicting the scientific acceptance of the hypothesis at some specific date in the future. An agent may include any hypothesized cause of an outcome, including a chemical, a material, a process, a business practice, and/or a behavior, among numerous other possibilities. In some examples, a causation score may be determined based on a corpus of scientific publications, such as a database of articles and/or abstracts, or metadata corresponding to individual scientific publications. For example, each abstract or article may be annotated with metadata, and the causation score may be determined based on some or all of the set of metadata across the corpus. A future causation score distribution can be projected by first generating one or more future publication datasets, and then determining causation scores for each of the one or more future publication datasets.",
