Aspects also relate to a method that improves a training dictionary in multi-sensor scenarios. Aspects also relate to a method that takes into account the effect of the acoustic path while training multichannel acoustic data. Aspects also relate to methods that cope with time-frequency limitations for training machine learning algorithms.",
