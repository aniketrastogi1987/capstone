  "abstract": "A pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) system is disclosed that determines an optimized relevance model for a search query by utilizing a posterior relevance model to estimate the likelihood that an initial set of top-K retrieved documents would be retrieved given the posterior relevance model, re-ranking the top-K documents based on their respective estimates of likelihood of retrieval, determining a rank similarity between the initial ranking of the top-K documents and the re-ranking of the top-K documents, updating one or more model parameters of the posterior relevance model based on the rank similarity, and iteratively performing the above process until the rank similarity is maximized, at which point, the optimized relevance model is obtained.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one or more example embodiments of the disclosure, a method is disclosed that includes determining, by a computer processor, a set of search results returned for a search query, wherein the set of search results is ranked in accordance with a first ranking; determining, by the computer processor, a first relevance model; determining, by the computer processor and based at least in part on the first relevance model, a respective probability of retrieval of each search result in the set of search results; determining, by the computer processor, a second ranking for the set of search results based at least in part on the respective probability of retrieval of each result in the set of search results; determining, by the computer processor, a rank similarity between the first ranking and the second ranking; determining, by the computer processor, a second relevance model by updating at least one model parameter of the first relevance model based at least in part on the rank similarity; determining, by the computer processor, that the second relevance model is an optimized relevance model for the search query based at least in part on the rank similarity. In one or more other example embodiments of the disclosure, a system is disclosed that includes at least one memory storing computer-executable instructions; and at least one processor configured to access the at least one memory and execute the computer-executable instructions to: determine a set of search results returned for a search query, wherein the set of search results is ranked in accordance with a first ranking; determine a first relevance model; determine, based at least in part on the first relevance model, a respective probability of retrieval of each search result in the set of search results; determine a second ranking for the set of search results based at least in part on the respective probability of retrieval of each result in the set of search results; determine rank similarity ...",
