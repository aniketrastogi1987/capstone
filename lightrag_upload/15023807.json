  "abstract": "This information processing system comprises: an object detection unit which detects and tracks an object in motion video data and detects a plurality of object elements which represent elements of the object; a feature value extraction unit which extracts respective feature values for each of the object elements from frame images which configure the motion video data; a frame selection unit which selects, for each object element, the frame images which satisfy respective frame selection criteria which are set for each object element; and a feature value linking unit which links frame specification information which specifies the frame images which are selected with the frame selection unit for each object element, and the object element feature values which are extracted from the selected frame images, and stores same in a prescribed storage unit.",
