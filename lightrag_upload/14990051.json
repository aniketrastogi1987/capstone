  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In some possible implementations, a device may include one or more processors. The one or more processors may obtain text to be processed to extract constraints corresponding to an object in the text. The constraints may define values permitted to be associated with the object. The one or more processors may extract the constraints based on identifying patterns in the text. The patterns may include a relational operator and a numeric value. The one or more processors may generate positive test data and negative test data, based on the constraints, for testing values for the object. The positive test data may include a first value that satisfies each of the constraints. The negative test data may include a second value that violates at least one of the constraints. The one or more processors may provide information that identifies the positive test data and the negative test data. In some possible implementations, a non-transitory computer readable medium may store instructions. The instructions may cause a processor to obtain text to be processed to extract a constraint corresponding to an object in the text. The constraint may define values permitted to be associated with the object. The instructions may cause the processor to extract the constraint based on identifying a pattern in the text. The instructions may cause the processor to generate, based on the constraint, positive test data and negative test data for testing values for the object. The positive test data may include a first value that satisfies the constraint. The negative test data may include a second value that violates the constraint. The instructions may cause the processor to provide information that identifies the positive test data and the negative test data. In some possible implementations, a method may include obtaining, by a device, text to be processed to extract constraints corresponding to an object in the text. The constraints may define values permitted to be associ...",
