  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>One aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a resource permission management method. The method includes monitoring, by a processor, a sensitivity of a target resource; and when the sensitivity of the target resource changes, adjusting, by the processor, a permission level of the target resource according to the sensitivity of the target resource. Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a resource permission management apparatus. The apparatus includes a monitoring module configured to monitor a sensitivity of a target resource; and an adjustment module configured to, when the sensitivity of the target resource changes, adjust a permission level of the target resource according to the sensitivity of the target resource. Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a webpage resource permission management method. The method includes monitoring, by a web browser, a sensitivity of a webpage resource; and when the sensitivity of the webpage resource changes, adjusting, by a processor on a server, a permission level of the webpage resource according to the sensitivity of the webpage resource. Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a webpage resource permission management apparatus. The method includes a monitoring module configured to monitor a sensitivity of a webpage resource; and an adjustment module configured to, when the sensitivity of the webpage resource changes, adjust a permission level of the webpage resource according to the sensitivity of the webpage resource. Additional features and advantages of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following detailed description, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present disclosure. The features and advantages of the present disclosure will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that ...",
