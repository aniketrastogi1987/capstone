  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF INVENTION <EOH>According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of operating a finite impulse response filter comprising an input; an output; and a plurality of storage elements, each coupled to the input via a sample switch and to the output via a transfer switch, the method comprising: during charging of the plurality of storage elements, applying a sample clock signal to each of the sample switches that achieves an operation mode where up to every one of the sample switches is simultaneously closed to connect all of the plurality of storage elements to the input; and during averaging of the plurality of storage elements, applying a transfer clock signal to each of the transfer switches to close one or more of the transfer switches to connect the storage elements, having charge stored therein, to the output. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a system comprising a finite impulse response filter comprising an input; an output; and a plurality of storage elements, each coupled to the input via a sample switch and to the output via a transfer switch, and a timing circuit configured to, during charging of the plurality of storage elements, apply a sample clock signal to each of the sample switches that achieves an operation mode where up to every one of the sample switches is simultaneously closed to connect all of the plurality of storage elements to the input; wherein the timing circuit is further configured to, during averaging of the plurality of storage elements, apply a transfer clock signal to each of the transfer switches to close one or more of the transfer switches to connect the storage elements, having charge stored therein, to the output.",
