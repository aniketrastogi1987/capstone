  "abstract": "Mechanisms are provided for evaluating a temporal relevance of a portion of content to a cognitive operation request. A cognitive operation request is received that comprises a portion of input text and the input text is analyzed, by a temporal relevance evaluation engine, to identify a temporal focus of the input text. A corpus of content is processed based on the input portion of text to generate candidate results each of which are processed to identify at least one contextual temporal focus associated with the candidate result. The at least one contextual temporal focus is compared with the temporal focus of the input text and a measure of temporal relevance of the candidate result is generated based on results of the comparison. The cognitive operation is performed based on the measure of temporal relevance.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described herein in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. In one illustrative embodiment, a method is provided, in a data processing system comprising at least one processor and a memory, the memory comprising instructions which are executed by the at least one processor to specifically configure the at least one processor to implement a cognitive system comprising a temporal relevance evaluation engine for evaluating a temporal relevance of a portion of content to a cognitive operation request. The method comprises receiving, by the cognitive system, a cognitive operation request comprising a portion of input text and analyzing, by the temporal relevance evaluation engine, the input text to identify a temporal focus of the input text. The method further comprises processing, by the temporal relevance evaluation engine, a corpus of content based on the input portion of text to generate candidate results and processing, by the temporal relevance evaluation engine, each candidate result, to identify at least one contextual temporal focus associated with the candidate result. The method also comprises comparing, by the temporal relevance evaluation engine, the at least one contextual temporal focus with the temporal focus of the input text and generating, by the temporal relevance evaluation engine, a measure of temporal relevance of the candidate result based on results of the comparison. Moreover, the method comprises performing, by the cognitive system, the cognitive operation based on the measure of temporal relevance. In other illustrative embodiments, a computer program product comprising a computer useable or readable medium having a computer readable program is provided. Th...",
