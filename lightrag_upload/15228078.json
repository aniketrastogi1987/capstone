  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>According to some embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a system on chip (SoC), comprising: an integrated circuit (IC) integrating the following into a single chip: at least one advance driver assistance systems (ADAS) processing unit, at least one application processing unit, at least one memory storing ADAS code comprising ADAS computer instructions adapted to be executed on the at least one ADAS processing unit for processing vehicle sensor data and VM code for executing on the at least one application processing unit at least one VM separately and independently from an execution of the ADAS code, and a hypervisor which manages an execution of at least one operation system (OS) of the at least one VM and an access to a processor shared memory of the at least one ADAS processing unit for acquiring an outcome of executing the ADAS computer instructions for the completion of an ADAS enhancing function by the execution of the at least one VM on the at least one application processing unit. Optionally, the hypervisor manages an allocation of a hardware resource shared by the at least one VM and at least one thread generated by an execution of the ADAS code by the at least one ADAS processing unit. More optionally, the allocation is done at a build or setup stage. More optionally, the hardware resource is the at least one application processing unit. More optionally, the hardware resource is selected from a group consisting of a display, a storage memory, serial AT Attachment (ATA) (SATA), and a universal serial bus (USB) port. More optionally, the at least one VM comprises an ADAS enhancing VM for executing a plurality of ADAS enhancing functions using the outcome. More optionally, the at least one VM further comprises at least one in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) VM for executing a plurality of IVI functions using the application processing unit. More optionally, the hypervisor prioritizes a usage of the at least one...",
