One embodiment comprises a neurosynaptic device including a memory device that maintains neuron attributes for multiple neurons. The module further includes multiple bit maps that maintain incoming firing events for different periods of delay and a multi-way processor. The processor includes a memory array that maintains a plurality of synaptic weights. The processor integrates incoming firing events in a time-division multiplexing manner. Incoming firing events are integrated based on the neuron attributes and the synaptic weights maintained.",

Incoming firing events are integrated based on the neuron attributes and the synaptic weights maintained. Another embodiment comprises maintaining neuron attributes for multiple neurons in a memory device, and maintaining incoming firing events for different periods of delay in multiple bit maps. Incoming firing events are integrated in a time-division multiplexing manner using a using a multi-way processor, wherein the processor includes a memory array that maintains a plurality of synaptic weights. The incoming firing events are integrated based on the neuron attributes and the synaptic weights maintained. These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become understood with reference to the following description, appended claims and accompanying figures.",
