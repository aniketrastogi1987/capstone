  "abstract": "Embodiments of the invention provide a method comprising creating a structural description for at least one neurosynaptic core circuit. Each core circuit comprises an interconnect network including plural electronic synapses for interconnecting one or more electronic neurons with one or more electronic axons. The structural description defines a desired neuronal activity for the core circuits. The desired neuronal activity is simulated by programming the core circuits with the structural description. The structural description controls routing of neuronal firing events for the core circuits.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method comprising creating a structural description for at least one neurosynaptic core circuit. Each core circuit comprises an interconnect network including plural electronic synapses for interconnecting one or more electronic neurons with one or more electronic axons. The structural description defines a desired neuronal activity for the core circuits. The desired neuronal activity is simulated by programming the core circuits with the structural description. The structural description controls routing of neuronal firing events for the core circuits. Another embodiment comprises a framework including at least one structural description for programming a neural network including multiple interconnected neural core circuits, wherein each core circuit comprises an interconnect network including plural electronic synapses for interconnecting one or more electronic neurons with one or more electronic axons. Each structural description defines a desired neuronal activity for at least one core circuit of the neural network. Each structural description controls the routing of neuronal firing events propagating through the neural network. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become understood with reference to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying figures.",
