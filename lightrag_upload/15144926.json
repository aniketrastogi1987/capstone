  "abstract": "In one embodiment, the present invention includes a processor having a fused multiply-add (FMA) unit to perform FMA instructions and add-like instructions. This unit can include an adder with multiple segments each independently controlled by a logic. The logic can clock gate at least one segment during execution of an add-like instruction in another segment of the adder when the add-like instruction has a width less than a width of the FMA unit. Other embodiments are described and claimed.",
