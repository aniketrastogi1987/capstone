  "abstract": "This invention provides a monitoring device and the like which exhibit high capability of detecting a state related to a system even when the system allows a plurality of objects to be monitored to complexly cooperate with each other. A monitoring device 1 includes a first model generation unit which divides, of first time-series information related to an object to be monitored, second time-series information associated with each item and generates models related to the pieces of divided information, and a determination unit which by applies third time-series information to the models to determine whether a correlation is maintained and performs determination related to each item based on results of the determining.",
