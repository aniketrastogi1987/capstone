  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The above and other problems are addressed by a system, a method, and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium. In one embodiment, the method includes receiving digital content and producing supplemental content metadata indicating a location of a feature in the digital content that is predicted to be of interest to a user. The method also includes creating a digital content package including the digital content and the supplemental content metadata. The method further includes providing the digital content package to an electronic device for presentation of the digital content in conjunction with a notification that a current position in the digital content is approaching the location of the feature. In one embodiment, the system includes a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing executable computer program code and one or more processors for executing the code. The executable computer program code includes instructions for receiving digital content and producing supplemental content metadata indicating a location of a feature in the digital content that is predicted to be of interest to a user. The executable computer program code also includes instructions for creating a digital content package including the digital content and the supplemental content metadata. The executable computer program code further includes instructions for providing the digital content package to an electronic device for presentation of the digital content in conjunction with a notification that a current position in the digital content is approaching the location of the feature.
