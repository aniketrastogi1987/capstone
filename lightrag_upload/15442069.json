  "abstract": "A system, a machine-readable storage medium storing instructions, and a computer-implemented method as described herein are directed to a Personalized Article Engine that generates respective prediction models for each article in a plurality of candidate articles in a social network system. The Personalized. Article Engine generates a respective article score according to each article's prediction model and at least one feature of a target member account. The Personalized Article Engine generates a plurality of output scores based on combining each respective article score with a corresponding article's global model score. The Personalized Article Engine ranks the output scores to identify a subset of candidate articles relevant to the target member account.",
