  "abstract": "Provided in the present invention are a method and apparatus for labeling training samples. In the embodiments of the present invention, two mutually independent classifiers, i.e. a first classifier and a second classifier, are used to perform collaborative forecasting on M unlabeled first training samples to obtain some of the labeled first training samples, without the need for the participation of operators; the operation is simple and the accuracy is high, thereby improving the efficiency and reliability of labeling training samples.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A method and apparatus for labeling training samples are provided in a plurality of aspects of the present invention, so as to improve the efficiency and reliability of labeling the training samples. A method for labeling training samples is provided in one aspect of the present invention, comprising: inputting M unlabeled first training samples into a first classifier to obtain a first forecasting result of each first training sample in the M first training samples, M being an integer greater than or equal to 1; according to the first forecasting result of each first training sample, selecting, from the M first training samples, N first training samples as second training samples, N being an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to M; inputting the N second training samples into a second classifier to obtain a second forecasting result of each second training sample in the N second training samples, the first classifier and the second classifier being independent of each other; according to the second forecasting result of each second training sample, selecting, from the N second training samples, P second training samples, P being an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to N; according to first forecasting results of other first training samples in the M first training samples, except the N second training samples, and the value of P, selecting, from the other first training samples, Q first training samples, Q being an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to Mâˆ’N; and according to second forecasting results of the P second training samples and each of the second training samples therein, generating P labeled second training samples, and according to first forecasting results of the Q first training samples and each of the first training samples therein, generating Q labeled first training samples. In the aspect as mentioned above and in any possible implementation, an implementation i...",
