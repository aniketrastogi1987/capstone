  "abstract": "At least an embodiment may provide a remote server that can obtain a distribution of revenue and expenditure in a farm field. There may be provided a remote server that receives position information, information on a harvest amount, information on an applying amount of a fertilizer, and information on an instantaneous fuel consumption amount. The remote server calculates a revenue/expenditure distribution map by a total of the revenue and expenditure, using a distribution of the harvest amount in a working area as the revenue and a distribution of the instantaneous fuel consumption amount as the expenditure based on position information of a tractor in one farm field, and using a distribution of the applying amount of the fertilizer and the instantaneous fuel consumption amount as the expenditure based on position information of a combine harvester.",
