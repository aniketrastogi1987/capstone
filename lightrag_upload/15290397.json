  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>A method, system and computer-usable medium are disclosed for cognitive inference and learning operations. In one embodiment, the invention relates to a system comprising: a processor; a data bus coupled to the processor; and a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium being coupled to the data bus. The computer program code interacting with a plurality of computer operations and comprising instructions executable by the processor and configured for: receiving data from a data source; determining whether the data comprises text; processing the data, the processing comprising performing a natural language processing operation on the data, the processing the data identifying a plurality of knowledge elements based upon the natural language processing operation; and, storing the knowledge elements within the cognitive graph as a collection of knowledge elements, the storing universally representing knowledge obtained from the data. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the computer program code comprising computer executable instructions configured for: receiving data from a data source; determining whether the data comprises text; processing the data, the processing comprising performing a natural language processing operation on the data, the processing the data identifying a plurality of knowledge elements based upon the natural language processing operation; and, storing at least some of the knowledge elements within the cognitive graph as a collection of knowledge elements, the storing universally representing knowledge obtained from the data.",
