  "abstract": "A method and system is provided for identifying patters in datasets by identifying delimited regions of feature-space in which patterns occur. The delimited regions are then combined into an ensemble able to make predictions based on the identified regions of feature-space. The method may be used for classification, for regression, for auto-encoding, for simulation, and for other applications of pattern detection.",
