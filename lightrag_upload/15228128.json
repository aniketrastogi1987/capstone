  "abstract": "A method includes identifying a graph of a social network, the graph including nodes and edges, each edge connects two nodes, some of the plurality of nodes represent members of the social network, some edges of the plurality of edges represent a relationship between two associated nodes, creating a first taste profile for a first member node, the taste profile identifying a first entity of interest to the first member, identifying a second member node based on an absence of a second taste profile for the second member node, the second member node is connected to the first member node, determining that the second member node is connected to the first member node, creating a second taste profile for the second member node using the first taste profile, and providing a recommendation to a member associated with the second member node based on the created second taste profile.",
