  "abstract": "The present disclosure relates to system(s) and method(s) to generate alerts while monitoring a machine learning model in real time. The system is configured to receive, in response to a first input parameter, a first output parameter generated by a first function of a learning model corresponding to a machine learning model. The system is further configured to receive, in response to a second input parameter, a second output parameter generated by a second functionality of a real-time model corresponding to the machine learning model. Further, the system is configured to compare the first output parameter with the second output parameter and the first input parameter with the second input parameter to generate tuning and rebuilding alerts.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This summary is provided to introduce aspects related to systems and methods for generate alerts while monitoring a machine learning model in real time and the aspects are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended for use in determining or limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter. In one embodiment, a system to generate alerts while monitoring a machine learning model in real time is illustrated. The system comprises a processor coupled to a memory, wherein the processor is configured to execute programmed instructions stored in the memory. The processor may execute a programmed instruction stored in the memory for receiving, in response to a first input parameter, a first output parameter generated by a first function of a learning model corresponding to a machine learning model. The processor may further execute a programmed instruction stored in the memory for receiving, in response to a second input parameter, a second output parameter generated by a second functionality of a real-time model corresponding to the machine learning model. In one embodiment, the first functionality and the second functionality are configured to perform a same function. The processor may further execute a programmed instruction stored in the memory for comparing the first output parameter with the second output parameter to determine an output variation score. In one embodiment, the comparison is based on a data type corresponding to the first output parameter and the second output parameter. The processor may further execute a programmed instruction stored in the memory for comparing the first input parameter with the second input parameter to determine an input variation score. In one embodiment, the comparison is based on a data type corresponding to the first input parameter and the second input parameter. The processor may further exe...",
