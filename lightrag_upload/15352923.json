  "abstract": "Techniques for generating a personality trait model are described. According to an example, a system is provided that can generate text data and linguistic data, and apply psycholinguistic data to the text data and the linguistic data, resulting in updated text data and updated linguistic data. The system is further operable to combine the updated text data with the updated linguistic data to generate a personality trait model. In various embodiments, the personality trait model can be trained and updated as additional data is received from various inputs.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The following presents a summary to provide a basic understanding of one or more embodiments of the invention. This summary is not intended to identify key or critical elements, or delineate any scope of the particular embodiments or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. According to one embodiment, a computer-implemented method includes generating, by a device operatively coupled to a processor, text data associated with speech data; generating, tone data associated with the speech data; augmenting, the text data with psycholinguistic data to generate updated text data; and correlating, the tone data to the updated text data to generate text-speech hybrid data. Other embodiments include a system and a computer program product.",
