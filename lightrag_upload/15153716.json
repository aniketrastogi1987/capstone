  "abstract": "In conventional techniques, types of attributes that can be distinguished are limited. An attribute deciding apparatus comprises: an operation pattern comparing unit that compares an operation history of a communication terminal with one or more predetermined operation patterns to decide, for each of the one or more operation patterns, at least either of an appearance frequency and an appearance probability in a predetermined period of time; and an attribute deciding unit that decides an attribute pattern conforming to an attribute of a user of the communication terminal from among one or more predetermined attribute patterns based on at least either of the appearance frequency and the appearance probability for each of the one or more operation patterns.",
