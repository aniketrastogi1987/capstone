  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Accordingly, the present disclosure has been made to address at least the problems and/or disadvantages described herein and to provide at least the advantages described below. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a method for deep learning training is provided which includes receiving candidate units for classification and classifying the candidate units by soft labelling, wherein the soft labelling provides at least one label comprising a plurality of possible values in a range between 0 and 1. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an apparatus for deep learning training is provided, including one or more non-transitory computer-readable media; and at least one processor which, when executing instructions stored on one or more non-transitory computer readable media, performs the steps of receiving candidate units for classification and classifying the candidate units by soft labelling, wherein the soft labelling provides at least one label comprising a plurality of possible values in a range between 0 and 1. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided for manufacturing a chipset capable of deep learning training which includes at least one processor which, when executing instructions stored on one or more non-transitory computer readable media, performs the steps of receiving candidate units for classification and classifying the candidate units by soft labelling, wherein the soft labelling provides at least one label comprising a plurality of possible values in a range between 0 and 1; and the one or more non-transitory computer-readable media which store the instructions. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided for testing an apparatus, including testing whether the apparatus has at least one processor which, when executing instructions stored on one or more non-transitory computer readable media, performs deep learning training including the steps of receiving ...",
