For each time series data set, an object is initiated to perform the predictive analysis for the corresponding time series data set. Generally, the predictive analysis predicts expected outcomes based on the corresponding time series data set. Each object is concurrently executed to generate expected outcomes associated with the corresponding time series data set, and the expected outcomes associated with each of the corresponding time series data sets are provided for display.",

In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, a request to perform a predictive analysis in association with multiple time series data sets is received. Thereafter, the request is parsed to identify each of the time series data sets to use in predictive analyses. For each time series data set, an object is initiated to perform the predictive analysis for the corresponding time series data set. Generally, the predictive analysis predicts expected outcomes based on the corresponding time series data set. Each object is concurrently executed to generate expected outcomes associated with the corresponding time series data set, and the expected outcomes associated with each of the corresponding time series data sets are provided for display. This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.",
