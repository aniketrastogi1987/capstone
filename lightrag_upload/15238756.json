  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided a computer-implemented method of identifying at least one data object of a predefined content category within a network document for presentation at a client terminal, comprising: receiving, at a network node at an internet service provider (ISP) level of a network, web resource elements of a network document for rendering and presentation on a display associated with a client terminal; identifying a plurality of data objects within the network document; extracting a plurality of classification features from each data object; classifying at least one of the data objects into a predefined content category; generating reformatting instructions for adapting the presentation of the network document to reduce visibility of the data objects classified into the predefined content category upon rendering of the network document; creating a formatted network document by injecting the reformatting instructions into the network document for implementation by a rendering process executing on the client terminal; and transmitting the formatted network document to the client terminal. Optionally, the predefined content category is ad-related content or user accessed content. Optionally, at least some extracted classification features are at least one of: common to different ad-related content objects, and common to ad-related content and user-accessed content. Optionally, the extracted classification features include classification features that are statistically insignificantly correlated with ad-related content and user-accessed related content. Optionally, wherein the extracted classification features common to different ad-related content objects comprises extracted classification features common to different ad-related content objects originating from different ad server sources. Optionally, the classifying is performed on at least one new data object rep...",
