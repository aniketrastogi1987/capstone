  "abstract": "A computer-implemented machine-learning method and system for searching for resources by predicting an intention and pushing resources directly to users based on the predicted intention. The method includes receiving a description of a context; generating a set of weighted expressions, each weighed expression comprising a restriction over the description of the context and a confidence factor resulting between the combination of the user model and of the query input; and generating a sorted list of resources matching the weighted list of expressions. The system includes computer instructions for an intention inference engine and an intelligent ranking engine.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a computer system comprising a processor and a non-transitory computer-readable memory, the memory encoded with computer-executable instructions for searching for resources by predicting an intention and pushing resources directly to users based on the predicted intention. The instructions provide for an intention inference engine which receives, as an input, a description of a context and generates, as output, a set of weighted expressions, each weighed expression comprising a restriction over the description of the context and a confidence factor resulting between the combination of the user model and of the query input. The instructions also provide for an intelligent ranking engine which receives, as input, the weighted list of expressions generated by the intention inference engine; and generates, as output, a sorted list of resources matching the weighted list of expressions. Other embodiments of the present invention are directed to a non-transitory computer-readable medium encoded with computer-executable instructions for searching for resources by predicting an intention and pushing resources directly to users based on the predicted intention. The instructions provide for an intention inference engine which receives, as an input, a description of a context and generates, as output, a set of weighted expressions, each weighed expression comprising a restriction over the description of the context and a confidence factor resulting between the combination of the user model and of the query input. The instructions also provide for an intelligent ranking engine which receives, as input, the weighted list of expressions generated by the intention inference engine; and generates, as output, a sorted list of resources matching the weighted list of expressions.
