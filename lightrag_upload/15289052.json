  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An apparatus, method, and non-transitory computer-readable media are provided for spatial processing of concepts. A processing device is provided including a non-transitory memory comprising a distance matrix and instructions, with the distance matrix including values representing dissimilarities among a plurality of concepts stored in a knowledgebase, and one or more processors in communication with the memory. The one or more processors execute the instructions to derive an inner product matrix based on the distance matrix, perform a spectral decomposition of the inner product matrix, generate a plurality of concept vectors based on the spectral decomposition of the inner product matrix, and output information associated with the plurality of concept vectors for spatial processing. A method is provided including a processing device deriving an inner product matrix based on a distance matrix, with the distance matrix including values representing dissimilarities among a plurality of concepts stored in a knowledgebase, the processing device performing a spectral decomposition of the inner product matrix, the processing device generating a plurality of concept vectors based on the spectral decomposition of the inner product matrix, and the processing device outputting information associated with the plurality of concept vectors for spatial processing. A non-transitory computer-readable media storing computer instructions is provided, that when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the steps of deriving an inner product matrix based on a distance matrix, with the distance matrix including values representing dissimilarities among a plurality of concepts stored in a knowledgebase, performing a spectral decomposition of the inner product matrix, generating a plurality of concept vectors based on the spectral decomposition of the inner product matrix, and outputting information associated with the plurality of ...",
