  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Techniques implementing trapless shadow page tables in a virtualized host system are provided. In one embodiment, an SPT accelerator device of the host system can intercept a memory write operation originating from a virtual machine (VM) and directed to a guest OS page table of the VM, where the guest OS page table is stored in a device memory of the SPT accelerator device. The SPT accelerator device can further extract a guest virtual address (GVA)-to-guest physical address (GPA) mapping in the memory write instruction and can translate the GVA-to-GPA mapping into a GVA-to-host physical address (HPA) mapping. The SPT accelerator device can then write the GVA-to-HPA mapping to a shadow page table of the host system. The following detailed description and accompanying drawings provide a better understanding of the nature and advantages of particular embodiments.",
