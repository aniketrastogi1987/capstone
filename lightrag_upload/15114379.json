  "abstract": "A method of modeling elements in an automated test of a software application is disclosed. An attribute is created for a set of user-interface elements of a selected species. The attribute defines interactions for the selected species. The user-interface elements are reduced to a primitive type. An application program interface can be used to apply the attribute to the software application.",
