  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a neural network system implemented by one or more computers that includes a batch normalization layer between a first neural network layer and a second neural network layer, wherein the first neural network layer generates first layer outputs having a plurality of components, where the batch normalization layer is configured to, during training of the neural network system on a batch of training examples: receive a respective first layer output for each training example in the batch; compute a plurality of normalization statistics for the batch from the first layer outputs; normalize each component of each first layer output using the normalization statistics to generate a respective normalized layer output for each training example in the batch; generate a respective batch normalization layer output for each of the training examples from the normalized layer outputs; and provide the batch normalization layer output as an input to the second neural network layer. For a system of one or more computers to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the system has installed on it software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them that in operation cause the system to perform the operations or actions. For one or more computer programs to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the one or more programs include instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operations or actions. Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. A neural network system that includes one or more batch normalization layers can be trained more quickly than an otherwise identical neural network that does not include any batch normalization layers. For exampl...",
