  "abstract": "Achieving orthogonal control of non-orthogonal qubit parameters of a logical qubit allows for increasing the length of a qubit chain thereby increasing the effective connectivity of the qubit chain. A hybrid qubit is formed by communicatively coupling a dedicated second qubit to a first qubit. By tuning a programmable parameter of the second qubit of a hybrid qubit, an effective programmable parameter of the hybrid qubit is adjusted without affecting another effective programmable parameter of the hybrid qubit thereby achieving orthogonal control of otherwise non-orthogonal qubit parameters. The length of the logical qubit may thus be increased by communicatively coupling a plurality of such hybrid qubits together.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>Increasing the length of a chain of qubits is desirable because such increases the effective connectivity of the qubit chain, allowing more complicated problems to be mapped to the quantum processor. Therefore, there is a need in the art for systems and/or methods of increasing the length of a qubit chain in a quantum processor without degrading the effective parameters (such as the effective tunneling amplitude) of the qubit chain.",
