  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for low power storage array with metadata access, comprising: sequentially writing data to a currently active disk drive in a storage array; storing metadata relating to the writes in a preallocated portion of the currently active disk drive; determining when the currently active disk drive is nearing full capacity; activating a next disk drive and cloning the stored metadata from the preallocated portion of the currently active disk drive to a preallocated portion of the next disk drive; and, when the currently active disk drive is full, sequentially writing data to the next disk drive. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for low power storage array with metadata access, comprising: a sequential write component for sequentially writing data to a currently active disk drive in a storage array; a metadata component for storing metadata relating to the writes in a preallocated portion of the currently active disk drive; a near capacity determining component for determining when the currently active disk drive is nearing full capacity; a disk activator component for activating a next disk drive and a metadata cloning component for cloning the stored metadata from the preallocated portion of the currently active disk drive to a preallocated portion of the next disk drive; and, when the currently active disk drive is full, the sequential write component sequentially writing data to the next disk drive. According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a computer program product for low power storage array with metadata access, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a processor to cause the processor to: sequentially write data to a currently active disk drive in a storage array; store met...",
