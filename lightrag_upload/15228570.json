  "abstract": "In various implementations, a method includes receiving a set of time series data that corresponds to a metric. A seasonal pattern is extracted from the set of time series data and the extracted seasonal pattern is filtered from the set of time series data. A predictive model is generated from the filtered set of data. The extracted seasonal pattern is filtered from another set of time series data where the second set of time series data corresponds to the metric. The filtered second set of time series data is compared to the predictive model. An alert is generated to a user for a value within the filtered second set of time series data which falls outside of the predictive model.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Aspects of the present disclosure relate to an anomaly detection technology that can improve detection of anomalies within time series data. The disclosed anomaly detection technology can accurately track time series data with any granularity, regardless of the number of seasonal patterns in the data, and without requiring a large number of parameters. In some respects, the disclosed anomaly detection technology analyzes historic time series data and decomposes the data to extract seasonal patterns therefrom. The technology can automatically determine the prominent seasonal patterns and select a seasonal pattern therefrom to set a seasonal period for a predictive model. Thus, users need not specify the seasonality in the time series data. In further respects, the disclosed anomaly detection technology filters contributions of prominent seasonal patterns from the historic time series data used to train a predictive model. Doing so allows the predictive model to estimate fewer parameters that are more accurate due to the historic time series data being simplified. The technology can use the trained predictive model to analyze new time series data and generate at least one alert when at least one value falls outside of expected ranges predicted by the predictive model. In doing so, the technology may filter the new time series data similar to the historic time series data used to train the predictive model. In some cases, the technology retrains the predictive model after analyzing the time series data for anomalies by adjusting parameters of the model to account for the new time series data.",
