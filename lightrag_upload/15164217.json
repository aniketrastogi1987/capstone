  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The present invention includes a method for diagnosing thyroid disease in a subject, the method comprising (a) providing a nucleic acid sample from a subject; (b) detecting the amount of one or more genes, gene products, or transcripts selected from the group consisting of the genes or transcripts listed in Tables 2 or their complement; and (c) determining whether said subject has or is likely to have a malignant or benign thyroid condition based on the results of step (b). The present invention also includes a composition comprising one or more binding agents that specifically bind to the one or more polymorphisms selected from the group consisting of the polymorphisms listed in Tables.",
