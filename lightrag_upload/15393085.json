  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>A data processing method receives a set of time-series user data and also receives a privacy requirement of the time-series user data. Next, the time-series user data is transformed using the privacy requirement such that the transforming satisfies differential privacy. A non-transitory processor-readable medium includes a program that, when executed by a processor, performs a method that receives a set of time-series user data and also receives a privacy requirement of the time-series user data. Next, the time-series user data is transformed using the privacy requirement such that the transforming satisfies differential privacy. An apparatus that transforms data includes an input that receives a set of time-series user data and that receives a privacy requirement of the time-series user data. The apparatus is configured to transform the time-series user data using the privacy requirement such that the transforming satisfies differential privacy. This summary is provided merely to produce certain concepts and not to identify any key or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Many of the features and embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the company drawings and from the following detailed description.",
