  "abstract": "A sign of the landslide disaster is easily detected. A model learning unit (120) of an anomaly detection device (100) learns a relational expression between vibration strengths at frequencies based on a time series of frequency characteristics of a vibration strength detected during a learning period by a vibration sensor placed on a monitoring target. The anomaly detection unit (140) learns a relational expression between vibration strengths at frequencies based on a time series of frequency characteristics of a vibration strength detected during a new period by the vibration sensor. Then, the anomaly detection unit (140) determines whether or not there is an anomaly in the monitoring target based on a relational expression related to a new frequency, which is different from the relational expression learned during the learning period.",
