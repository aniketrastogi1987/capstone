  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In some implementations, windows can be displayed based on a global z order. The global z-order can be maintained for all windows and can include windows that are not currently displayed. The global z-order can define a display order of windows across multiple workspaces. In some implementations, workspaces can be associated with levels. The workspace levels can be used to determine how to display windows associated with each workspace when multiple workspaces are displayed simultaneously. Particular implementations provide at least the following advantages: Displaying windows based on a global z-order can provide a consistent window display across workspaces thereby reducing user confusion and improving ease of use. Displaying workspace windows based on workspace levels allows users to prioritize workspaces. Windows associated with high priority workspaces to be viewed and accessed more quickly than lower priority workspace windows. Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and potential advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",

The global z-order can include windows that are not currently displayed. The global z-order can define a display order of windows across multiple workspaces. In some implementations, workspaces can be associated with respective levels. The workspace levels can be used to determine how to display windows associated with each workspace when multiple workspaces are displayed simultaneously.",
