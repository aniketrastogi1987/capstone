  "abstract": "The present invention has given systems and methods for virtual recruitment of different candidates based on state model and, more specifically, candidate responses received during conversation session are recorded to create general pattern model that would be applied in the future session to give candidates a better personalized and immersive experience. The method comprises of providing a system-input to a user via at least one output unit of a system during a conversation session initiated by the user. The system-input being one of: information, question, and query. Receiving a user-input from the user in the conversation session from one or more one or more input devices coupled to the system. The input can be combination of audio, video, and text. After that, deduce the intent of the user-input. Then determining a response based at least in part on the query and the deduced intent and providing the response on the output unit within the conversation session.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In accordance with the purposes of the invention, the present invention as embodied and broadly described herein, provides an intelligent conversation system. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a user-input is received in a conversation session from one or more input devices coupled to a user-device. The user-input can be audio, video, text, or any combination thereof. In one aspect of the invention, a system-input is provided to the user, prior to receiving the user-input, via at least one output unit of the user-device during the conversation session ebbing initiated by the user. The system-input being one of: information, question, and query. The system-input is selected from a script pre-associated with the conversation session. The script includes a list of questions, corresponding answers, and actions. Further, the conversation session is pre-associated with a plurality of context factors and a profile of the user. Thereafter, intent of the user input is deduced. The intent is deduced based on a plurality of parameters identified from the user-input. The parameters include similarity of concept between the user-input and the system-input, sentiment of the user, emotion of the user, gesture of the user, tone of the user, body language of the user, expression of the user, code of conduct of the user, environmental factors, and a duration from said providing until receiving of the user-input from the user. Thereafter, a response is determined based on the deduced intent, intent deduced from user-input corresponding to system-input within a plurality of pre-stored conversation sessions, and the script. Further, the conversation session follows a state machine model implementation and therefore a state-machine model is pre-associated with the conversation session. The determination of the response also comprises of determining current state in state machine model based on the system-input. The state-machine model is traversed based on the user-input...",
