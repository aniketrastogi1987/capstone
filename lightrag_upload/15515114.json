  "abstract": "Disclosed is a computer-implemented method for generating a user interface to a data analysis engine comprising a plurality of analysis tools. The method comprises providing a methods knowledge base comprising rules which map data types and/or analysis goals to analysis tools; an inference engine; and a user interface module. The method further comprises receiving, by the user interface module, input relating to one or more user-defined analysis goals; determining, by the inference engine, one or more required data sets based on the one or more user-defined analysis goals; determining, by the inference engine using the methods knowledge base, one or more recommended analysis tools based on the one or more user-defined analysis goals and the one or more required data sets; and outputting, to the user interface module, a control component for each of the one or more recommended analysis tools, each control component being configured to, on detection of a user input event, execute the res...",
