  "abstract": "An apparatus and method are described for a neuromorphic processor design in which neuron timing information is duplicated on a neuromorphic core. For example, one embodiment of an apparatus comprises: a first neurosynaptic core comprising a plurality of neurons and a synapse array comprising a plurality of synapses to communicatively couple the plurality of neurons, each synapse connecting two neurons having a weight associated therewith, wherein a first neuron is to generate an output spike based on the weights of synapses over which inputs are received from the other neurons; a second neurosynaptic core also comprising a plurality of neurons and having at least one counter to maintain a count value indicative of spike timing for a second neuron, wherein a spike output of the second neuron in the second neurosynaptic core is communicatively coupled over a first synapse to the first neuron in the first neurosynaptic core; and a duplicate counter maintained within the first neurosynapt...",
