  "abstract": "A parallel convolutional neural network is provided. The CNN is implemented by a plurality of convolutional neural networks each on a respective processing node. Each CNN has a plurality of layers. A subset of the layers are interconnected between processing nodes such that activations are fed forward across nodes. The remaining subset is not so interconnected.",
