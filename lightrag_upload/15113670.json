  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>To solve a problem that an accuracy rate of recommending a network service to a single user is reduced because a backend system recommends a network service to a single user according to an interest standard of an entire user group, embodiments of the present invention provide a network service recommendation method and apparatus. The technical solutions are as follows: According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a network service recommendation method is provided, the method including: retrieving, according to a historical browsing record of a user during use of a network service, a label corresponding to each network service used by the user; determining, according to a label-topic correspondence, and by using the label corresponding to each network service used by the user, first n topics corresponding to the user, the first n topics being top n topics according to a descending order of browsing probability of the user, and n being a positive integer; acquiring, according to a topic-network service correspondence, respective corresponding recommended network service lists of the first n topics, the recommended network service list of each topic including at least one network service; and recommending a network service to the user according to the respective corresponding recommended network service lists of the first n topics. According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, a network service recommendation apparatus is provided, the apparatus including: a retrieval module, configured to retrieve, according to a historical browsing record of a user during use of a network service, a label corresponding to each network service used by the user; a topic determination module, configured to determine, according to a label-topic correspondence, and by using the label that is retrieved by the retrieval module and corresponds to each network service used by the user, first n topics corresponding to the user, the first n topics being ...",
