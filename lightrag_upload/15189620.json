  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In accordance with an embodiment of the present principles, a cognitive learning device includes inputs with each including an input path having a transistor device having a storage capacity. A circuit is responsive to the inputs and selects an input set in accordance with a current task, wherein the input set selected modifies a characteristic of the transistor device of one or more corresponding input paths to bias the input set for selection for subsequent accesses. Another cognitive learning device includes a plurality of inputs, each input including an input path. At least one transistor device is associated with each input path, and the at least one transistor device has a storage capacity such that a threshold voltage of the at least one transistor device is modified in accordance with access criteria. A comparator circuit is responsive to the plurality of inputs and selects an input set in accordance with a current task such that the input set selected modifies the threshold voltage of the at least one transistor device to bias input paths associated with the input set for selection for subsequent accesses. A method for employing a cognitive learning device includes randomly selecting a path initially among a plurality of input paths, each having at least one transistor; determining a correct input path for performing a current task; and modifying a threshold voltage of the at least one transistor associated with the correct path to bias selection of the correct path in subsequent accesses. These and other features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.",
