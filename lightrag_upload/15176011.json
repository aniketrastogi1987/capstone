  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Provided are a computer program product, system, and method for sharing alias addresses among logical devices for a control unit managing access by hosts to logical devices configured with capacity from attached physical devices. An alias management group of logical devices and alias addresses assigned to the logical devices is configured for use to access the logical devices. A plurality of requests to establish an association of the host with a logical device and the alias addresses assigned to the logical devices in the alias management group are received from a host. Acknowledgment is made to the host that the association is established in response to determining that the host is assigned the logical devices and alias addresses of the logical devices in the alias management group, wherein the host can use one available alias address assigned to any one of the logical devices indicated in the association to access any one of the logical devices indicated in the association. With the described embodiments, a host may obtain an alias address to use for a request to a logical device that is associated with a different logical device. In this way, alias addresses remaining unused for one logical device may be made available to access a different logical device to provide a mechanism for efficiently using alias addresses. Described embodiments accomplish this sharing of alias addresses among logical devices, which may comprise logical volumes configured in logical subsystems, by creating an alias management group associating the logical devices and their alias addresses for sharing. In a further embodiment, the alias management group consists of a set of logical device and a set of alias addresses in which two or more hosts have access to one or more alias addresses in common and where two or more hosts have access to a set of logical volumes such that each host shares the common alias addresses to only access logical volumes that they are configure...",
