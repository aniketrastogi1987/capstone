  "abstract": "Embodiments of the present disclosure include systems and methods for image processing for enhancing, e.g., photos, videos, and graphics representations. Particularly, some embodiments perform a histogram-based SMQT decomposition of various attributes in an original image. The SMQT decomposition of these attributes may then be used to create a look-up-table indicating how to modify pixel attributes in the same or a subsequent image so as to enhance the same or subsequent image. The results of the SMQT decomposition for each attribute may be interpolated based, e.g., on user preferences, to achieve a more optimal enhancement.",
