  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The disclosure is directed to a system and a method for predicting a remaining useful life (RUL) of a component of an equipment. According to one embodiment, a system for predicting a remaining useful life (RUL) of a component of an equipment is provided. The system includes a data acquisition (DAQ) unit, a feature capturing unit, a mapping function generating unit, a similarity analyzing unit and a RUL calculating unit. The DAQ unit is for obtaining a real time sensing record. The feature capturing unit is for obtaining an estimation feature according to the real time sensing record, and obtaining a plurality of training features according to a plurality of history sensing records. The mapping function generating unit is for obtaining a mapping function according to the training features. The mapping function includes a relationship between the training features and at least one predicting value. The similarity analyzing unit is for obtaining k similar features which are similar to the estimation feature according to the training features. The RUL calculating unit is for obtaining the at least one predicting value via the mapping function according to the k similar features and calculating an estimation RUL according to the at least one predicting value. According to another embodiment, a method for predicting a remaining useful life (RUL) of a component of equipment is provided. The method includes the following steps. A real time sensing record is obtained. An estimation feature is obtained according to the real time sensing record, and a plurality of training features are obtained according to a plurality of history sensing records. A mapping function is obtained according to the training features. The mapping function includes a relationship between the training features and at least one predicting value. k similar features which are similar to the estimation feature are obtained according to the training features. The at least one predicting...",
