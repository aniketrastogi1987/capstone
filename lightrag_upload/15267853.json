  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>One non-limiting and exemplary embodiment provides a device management method and device management apparatus with improved ease of use for the user by doing away with unnecessary notifications to the user. In one general aspect, the techniques disclosed here feature a device management method of a device management apparatus that manages information of devices installed in a home includes: acquiring electric power consumption per unit time in predetermined time intervals, for each of branch circuits of a power distribution board to which the devices can be connected; estimating existence of the devices connected to the branch circuit; based on change of electric power consumption over time, per unit time; condition determining whether or not an estimated device, which is a device regarding which existence has been estimated in the estimating, satisfies a predetermined condition; and transmitting inquiry information to a user in accordance with the predetermined condition, only in a case where determination is made in the condition determining that the estimated device satisfies the predetermined condition. According to the above aspect, inquiry information is transmitted to the user in accordance with predetermined conditions, only in a case where an estimated device regarding which existence has been estimated satisfies predetermined conditions, so unnecessary notifications to the user are done away with and the load of the device management apparatus transmitting information can be reduced, and also ease of use of the user can be improved. It should be noted that general or specific embodiments may be implemented as a system, a method, an integrated circuit, a computer program, a storage medium, or any selective combination thereof. Additional benefits and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will become apparent from the specification and drawings. The benefits and/or advantages may be individually obtained by the various embodiments and fe...",
