  "abstract": "Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for predictive modeling for adjusting initial values are disclosed. In one aspect, a method includes the actions of accessing transaction history data that indicates one or more transaction details associated with the transaction, a predicted value, and a final value. The actions further include determining a difference value between the predicted value and the final value. The actions further include generating a predictive model that is trained to estimate. The actions further include receiving one or more transaction details and a predicted value associated with a subsequently received transaction. The actions further include providing the one or more transaction details as input to the predictive model. The actions further include receiving an adjustment value to apply to the predicted value. The actions further include providing, for output, data indicating the adjustment value.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Entities may apply predictive models to future orders to identify adjustments to initially predicted values. Once an entity has identified a predicted value for an order, the entity may apply a predictive model to generate an adjustment value to the predicted value. The predictive model is trained to generate an adjustment value that improves the accuracy of the predicted value so that the adjusted predicted value has a high likelihood of matching a final value for the order. The predictive model may be trained using previous order data, previous predicted values, and previous final values. An innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be implemented in a method that includes the actions of accessing transaction history data that, for each of one or more past transactions, indicates one or more transaction details associated with the transaction, a predicted value, and a final value, wherein the one or more transaction details include a sentiment associated with an entity requesting the transaction, a value sensitivity of the entity, and a relationship between the entity requesting the transaction and an entity processing the transaction; for each of the one or more past transactions, determining a difference value between the predicted value and the final value; for each of the one or more past transactions, generating, using the one or more transaction details and the difference value, a predictive model that is trained to estimate, based on one or more given transaction details and a given predicted value, an adjustment value to apply to the given predicted value; and receiving one or more transaction details and a predicted value associated with a subsequently received transaction; providing the one or more transaction details as input to the predictive model; in response to providing the one or more transaction details as input to the predictive model, receiving, from the predictive model, an adjustment value ...",
