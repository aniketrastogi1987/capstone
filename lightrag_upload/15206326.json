  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>One exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is a computer-implemented method comprising: selecting at least one subject according to a given topic; selecting at least one verb from a first data source; selecting at least one object from a second data source; generating one or more candidate claim sentences, each of which composed of a subject selected from the at least one subject, a verb selected from the at least one verb and an object selected from the at least on object; and determining validity of the candidate claim sentences using a machine learning process. Another exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is computerized apparatus having a processor, the processor being adapted to perform the steps of: selecting at least one subject according to a given topic; selecting at least one verb from a first data source; selecting at least one object from a second data source; generating one or more candidate claim sentences, each of which composed of a subject selected from the at least one subject, a verb selected from the at least one verb and an object selected from the at least on object; and determining validity of the candidate claim sentences using a machine learning process. Yet another exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is a computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage medium retaining program instructions, which program instructions when read by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method comprising: selecting at least one subject according to a given topic; selecting at least one verb from a first data source; selecting at least one object from a second data source; generating one or more candidate claim sentences, each of which composed of a subject selected from the at least one subject, a verb selected from the at least one verb and an object selected from the at least on object; and determining validity of the candidate claim sentences using...",
