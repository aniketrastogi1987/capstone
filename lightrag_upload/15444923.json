  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This document discusses systems and techniques for identifying native applications that are likely to be of interest to users, and providing opportunities for users to acquire the identified native applications on their mobile computing devices. For example, a computer system can identify interests of a particular mobile device user based on a variety of information that may indicate the user would be interested in one or more native applications, such as information identifying the user's use of web-based services (for which there may exist an associated native application), the user's web browsing history, browser bookmarks set by the user, and/or use of native applications by the particular user's acquaintances (e.g., social network friends). Using interests identified for a user, information identifying particular native applications that are consistent with the user's identified interests can be provided to the user in a variety of ways, such as through a push notification that is displayed on the mobile computing device, automatic installation of the particular native applications on the mobile computing device, and/or identification of the particular native applications in a portion of an application store that provides application recommendations. In one implementation, a computer-implemented method includes accessing, by a computer system, information that describes use of one or more computer-based services by a particular user from one or more computing devices that are associated with the particular user; identifying, by the computer system, one or more native applications that are associated with the one or more services, wherein the one or more native applications are configured to be installed and executed by one or more types of mobile computing devices; determining, by the computer system, whether to recommend the one or more native applications based on the information and one or more threshold levels of use of the one or more co...",
