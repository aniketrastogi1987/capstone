  "abstract": "Technologies for monitoring a characteristic of a monitored system include determining a measured value of the primary characteristic of the monitored system sensed by a primary sensor and a measured value of the secondary characteristic of the monitored system sensed by a secondary sensor, and predicating a predicted value of the primary characteristic based on the measured value of the secondary characteristic. The measured and predicted values of the primary characteristic are used to determine whether the primary sensor is properly functioning.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>The concepts described herein are illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the accompanying figures. For simplicity and clarity of illustration, elements illustrated in the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. Where considered appropriate, reference labels have been repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of at least one embodiment of a system for monitoring a characteristics of a monitored system using a predictive sensor module; FIG. 2 is a simplified block diagram of at least one embodiment of an environment that may be established by a sensor controller of the predictive sensor module of FIG. 1 ; FIGS. 3-4 are a simplified flow diagram of at least one embodiment of a method for monitoring a characteristic of the monitored system that may be executed by the sensor controller of FIGS. 1 and 2 ; and FIG. 5 is a graph that illustrates an initial predictive model and an updated predictive model of an illustrative embodiment of the sensor controller of FIGS. 1 and 2 . detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?",
