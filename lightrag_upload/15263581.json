  "abstract": "A convolutional neural network for classifying time series data uses a dynamic context selection. In one example a method includes receiving a plurality of inputs of different sizes at a convolutional neural network, applying convolution and pooling to each of the inputs to provide a plurality of outputs of different sizes, changing the size of each of the outputs to a selected uniform size, reshaping each of the outputs to a vector, and fully connecting the vectors.",
