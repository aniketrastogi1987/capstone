  "abstract": "A system for self-learning archival of electronic data may be provided. A binary classifier may identify a text segment of an electronic dataset in response to text of the electronic dataset being associated with indicators of a word model. A first multiclass classifier may generate a first classification set comprising respective statistical metrics for the datafield that each predefined identifier in a group of predefined identifiers is representative of the datafield. A second multiclass classifier may receive a context of the electronic dataset and generate a second classification set. A combination classifier may apply weight values to the first classification set and the second classification set and form a weighted classification set and select a predefined identifier as being representative of the datafield based on the weighted classification set. The processor may store, in a memory, a data record comprising an association between the predefined identifier and the datafield.",
