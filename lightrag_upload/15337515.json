  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>According to one aspect of the present invention, a detection apparatus includes a camera, a recognizer, and a first detector. The camera is configured to acquire image data around a vehicle. The recognizer is configured to recognize an area indicating a light of a traffic signal from the image data. The first detector is configured to detect that the vehicle runs through the light when a size of the area indicating the light is larger than a first threshold, a distance between the area indicating the light and an end of the image data is shorter than a second threshold, and velocity data of the vehicle is higher than a third threshold.",
