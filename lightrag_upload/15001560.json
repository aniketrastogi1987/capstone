  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In view of such problems of the related art, one aspect of the present invention is directed to enabling determination of whether a program can be installed. According to one embodiment of the present invention, an information processing apparatus is provided that includes a first acquisition unit configured to acquire a data size of a program to be installed; a second acquisition unit configured to acquire an available storage capacity of a storage medium corresponding to an install location of the program; a determination unit configured to determine whether the program can be installed in the storage medium by calculating a consumption amount of storage capacity of the storage medium for storing the data size acquired by the first acquisition unit based on a smallest consumption unit of storage capacity of the storage medium, and comparing the calculated consumption amount with the available storage capacity; and an execution unit configured to install the program in the storage medium if the determination unit determines that the program can be installed in the storage medium.",
