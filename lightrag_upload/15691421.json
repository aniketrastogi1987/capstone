  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>It is an object of the present invention to at least partially solve the problems in the conventional technology. According to one aspect of an embodiment a generation apparatus includes a selection unit that selects a model to be used for generating a response based on one of conditions input from a user among from a plurality of models for generating responses to inquiries, the models being for generating the responses corresponding to the conditions that are different from one another. The generation apparatus includes a generation unit that generates the response to an inquiry from the user by using the model selected by the selection unit. The above and other objects, features, advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.",
