  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present invention is to provide a clustering method based on iterations of neural networks. The present invention is based on a framework of traditional clustering algorithm, uses neural networks on similarity measurement and optimizes network structure continuously to get a more accurate similarity measurement. The present invention may be implemented by: a clustering method based on iterations of neural networks comprising the following steps: step 1, initializing parameters of an extreme learning machine; step 2, randomly choosing samples of which number is equal to the number of clusters, each sample representing one cluster; and training the extreme learning machine to obtain an initial output weights between hidden-layer and output-layer; step 3, using current extreme learning machine to cluster samples; step 4, choosing multiple samples from each cluster as exemplars for the cluster according to a rule; step 5, retraining the extreme learning machine by using the exemplars for each cluster obtained from previous step; and step 6, outputting clustering result if termination condition is met, otherwise going back to step 3. Preferably, step 1 comprises two substeps: substep 1.1, setting a number of hidden-layer neurons L, an activation function of hidden-layer g(θ), and a regularization factor γ of the extreme learning machine, wherein the number of hidden-layer neurons L is greater than a feature dimension d of sample, the activation function of hidden-layer g(θ) usually adopts Sigmoid function, and value range of the regularization factor γ is generally [10 −5 , 10 10 ]; and substep 1.2, randomly initializing weights between input-layer and hidden-layer W and a bias b of the extreme learning machine, wherein the weights between input-layer and hidden-layer W is a random matrix with d rows and L columns whose random range is [−1,1], and the bias b is a random matrix with 1 row and L columns whose random range is [−1,1], one of columns of...",
