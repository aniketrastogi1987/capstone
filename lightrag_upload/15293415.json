  "abstract": "In one embodiment, a touch sensor includes a first electrode, a second electrode, and a spacer layer located between the first electrode and the second electrode. One of the first electrode and the second electrode is a drive electrode to which a drive signal is applied. The other one of the first electrode and the second electrode is a receiving electrode that receives the drive signal by a mutual capacitance between the first electrode and the second electrode. When an external pressure is applied to the first electrode through a display, the first electrode is concavely bent toward the second electrode. The mutual capacitance between the first electrode and the second electrode changes according to a distance between the first electrode and the second electrode. The magnitude of the external pressure according to the change of the capacitance between the first electrode and the second electrode is detected.",
