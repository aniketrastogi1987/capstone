  "abstract": "Social media networks have become a primary source for news and opinions on topics ranging from sports to politics. Sentiment analysis is typically constrained to two classesâ€”positive and negative. A computing system is herein described for building a multi-sentiment multi-label model for electronic data that uses emojis as class labels. The electronic messages are classified into six sentiment classes. The computing system collects and creates a large corpus of clean and processed training data with emoji-based sentiment classes using little-to-no manual intervention. A threshold-based formulation is used to assign one or two class labels (multi-label) to an electronic message. The multi-sentiment multi-label model produces a desirable cross validation accuracy.",
