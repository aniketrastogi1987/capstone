  "abstract": "A mechanism for command stream processing is described. A method of embodiments, as described herein, includes fetching cache lines from a memory to fill command first in first out buffer (FIFO), wherein the fetched cachelines an overfetching of data necessary to process a command, a first parser to fetch and execute batch commands stored in the command FIFO and a second parser to fetch commands and execute the batch commands and non-batch commands stored in the command FIFO.",
