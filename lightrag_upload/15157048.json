  "abstract": "Disclosed are systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable storage media for predicting a future context of a computing device. In some implementations, a context daemon can use historical context information to predict future events and/or context changes. For example, the context daemon can analyze historical context information to predict user sleep patterns, user exercise patterns, and/or other user activity. In some implementations, a context client can register a callback for a predicted future context. For example, the context client can request to be notified ten minutes in advance of a predicted event and/or context change. The context daemon can use the prediction to notify a context client in advance of the predicted event.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Disclosed are systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable storage media for monitoring the current context of a computing device. In some embodiments, a context daemon can collect context information about the computing device. The context information can include current device hardware state information. The context information can include current software state information. The context can be derived or implied from a combination of hardware state information, software state information, or any other type of state information. For example, the derived context can be a user state (e.g., a user activity, sleeping, running, etc.) derived from or implied by hardware or software state information. In some embodiments, context information can be reported to the context daemon by context monitors. The context monitors can be specifically built for collecting context information monitored by the context daemon. The context monitors can be applications, utilities, tools, or the like that were built for other purposes, use or generate hardware or software state information, and report the state information to the context daemon. Once the context information has been collected, the context daemon can store the current context of the computing device in a central location so that context clients (e.g., software, applications, utilities, operating system, etc.) can obtain current context information from a single source. In some embodiments, the context daemon can generate and/or collect historical context information. The historical context information can include the old or outdated context information. The historical context information can be derived from the context information. Thus, the context daemon can provide a central repository of context information that context clients (e.g., processes) can use to determine the current context of the computing device. Disclosed are systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable storage media...",
