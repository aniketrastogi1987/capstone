  "abstract": "A learning apparatus in a digital environment is advantageous to interaction and communication among users who use a knowledge point structure for learning. The learning apparatus in the digital environment constructs a structurized knowledge library by editing knowledge points, tags of the knowledge points and a relationship among the knowledge points; then records a user's mastery degree for the knowledge points on the basis of the tags; and records knowledge learning information and social attribute information thereof for each user, so as to construct a general-class learning record, a single-class learning record and a general knowledge learning system of the user, which can also be used for the user to view the popularity of each tag in the knowledge library.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION <EOH>A brief summary on one or more aspects is given below to provide a basic understanding for these aspects. The summary is not a detailed review for all the conceived aspects, and is neither intended to point out all the critical or decisive factors for all the aspects nor attempting to define the scope of any or all of the aspects. Its only object is to provide in a simplified manner some concepts of one or more aspects as the preface of the more detailed description given later. An object of the present invention is to solve the above-mentioned problem, and provide a learning apparatus in a digital environment, which is advantageous to the interaction and communication between users who use knowledge point structures for learning. The technical solution of the present invention is as follows: the present invention reveals a learning apparatus in a digital environment. The system comprises a cloud server platform and a terminal device, wherein the cloud server platform further comprises a knowledge point structurized storage apparatus and a user information storage apparatus; the knowledge point structurized storage apparatus comprises a knowledge point library module, a tag library module, a relationship library module and a structurized knowledge library module, wherein: the knowledge point library module stores various knowledge points; the tag library module stores tags of the various knowledge points, with the tags and the knowledge points being in one-to-one correspondence; the relationship library module stores a relationship among the various knowledge points; and the structurized knowledge library module constructs a knowledge point structure based on the relationship among the various knowledge points and stores all the knowledge points with the structure; and the user information storage apparatus stores user information about various users, wherein each piece of user information at least contains a user attribut...",
