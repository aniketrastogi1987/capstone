  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The control module of the NVMe SSD in present lacks the capability to parse the disk status, such that the user cannot recognize the status of the NVMe SSD clearly. In addition, it is also difficult for the user to search the specific NVMe SSD or the power status when assembling the NVMe SSD. Accordingly, a system to control indicator lights for a NVMe SSD is provided in the present invention, which electrically connected to the component of the NVMe SSD to recognize whether the NVMe SSD is operated under an abnormal condition and light up the fail indicator light accordingly. In addition, the user is capable to identify the position of the specific NVMe SSD by lighting up the corresponding position indicator light. In accordance with the object of the present invention, a system to control indicator lights for non-volatile memory express (NVMe) solid state disk (SSD) is provided. The system comprises a NVMe SSD, a complex programmable logic device (CPLD), a controller, and a slave processor. The NVMe SSD has a control module for transmitting a disk position signal. The CPLD is electrically connected to the control module for receiving the disk position signal to light up a location indicator light. The controller is electrically connected to the CPLD to light up the location indicator light. The slave processor is electrically connected to the control module through an inter integrated circuit (I2C) bus. The slave processor includes a general purpose I/O (GPIO) port electrically connected to a fail indicator light. When the slave processor detects the NVMe SSD is operated under an abnormal condition, a fail signal is transmitted to the fail indicator light to light up the fail indicator light. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the controller is a platform controller hub (PCH). As a preferred embodiment, the system to control indicator lights for NVMe SSD further comprises a main board, and the PCH is loca...",
