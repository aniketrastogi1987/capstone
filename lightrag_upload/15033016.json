  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>It is an object of the present invention to provide a solution to this problem by taking account of the dose level resulting in a definite area of the target design from the proximity effect created by a first series of shots to determine the threshold of the exposure level of a second series of shots. To this effect, the invention discloses a method of generating a fracturing dataset of a surface into elementary features, said elementary features to be each exposed to at least one shot of a variable shaped beam (VSB) to transfer a free-form desired pattern onto the surface, said method comprising: a step of determining a paving of said free-form desired pattern by a first set of shots which each determine a rounded shot print; a step of determining a placement and dimension of a second set of shots which each determine a rounded shot print; a step of determining a dose level of a shot in the second set of shots, said step of determining being based on a comparison between a dose distribution on the surface resulting from applying the first set of shots and a resist threshold. Advantageously, the step of determining a dose level of a shot of the second set of shots consists in subtracting from the resist threshold the dose distribution applied by the first set of shots at at least a point of said shot in the second set of shots. Advantageously, the shots in the first set of shots, which determine rounded shot prints, are not formed by a circular beam and overlap. Advantageously, the shots in the first set of shots with overlap determine rounded shot prints which overlap. Advantageously, the shots in the first set of shots, which determine rounded shot prints, are not formed by a circular beam and do not overlap. Advantageously, the shots in the first set of shots with no overlap determine rounded shot prints which overlap. Advantageously, the method of the invention further comprises a step of determining a printed contour of the ...",

  "abstract": "A computer implemented method of fracturing free form target design into elementary shots for defined roughness of the contour comprises determining a first set of shots which pave the target design and determining a second set of shots to fill the gaps. The dose levels of overlapping shots in the first or second sets of shots are determined so the compounded dose is adequate to the resist threshold, considering the proximity effect of the actual imprint of shots on the insulated target. A dose geometry modulation is applied and rounded shot prints are produced by shots not circular that may overlap. The degree of overlap is determined as a function of desired optimization of fit criteria between a printed contour and the contour of the desired pattern. Placements and dimensions of the shots are determined by a plurality of fit criteria between printed contour and contour of the desired pattern.",
