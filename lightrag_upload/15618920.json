  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Systems, technologies and techniques for generating prospective legal strategies are disclosed. The system and technologies, such as THOMSON REUTERS SCENARIO ANALYTICSâ„¢, employ data mining, natural language processing and machine learning approaches to generate prospective legal strategies. The system and technologies analyze given case facts (i.e., background facts, event types such as accident, injury, malpractice, discrimination) and provide a rich set of insights that assist in formulating effective legal arguments and strategies. While there are attempts to utilize data-driven decision support processes, the present disclosure differs in that it does not focus on providing summary statistics, for example on how judges ruled on certain motions, but focuses on unearthing deeper patterns in the data. The system identifies and harnesses the underlying fact patterns in a case and compares them with similar fact patterns in prior cases stored in a large legal database. The database can include hundreds of thousands of jury verdict cases. The system generates a set of potential outcomes based on pools of editorially annotated data about similar cases that utilize similar arguments and a set of related characteristics (trial strategies, trial arguments, trial lengths, award asks, award assignments, etc.). Various aspects of the system relate to generating prospective legal strategies. For example, according to one aspect, the system includes a legal data store comprising a set of cases and corresponding case summaries, and a scenario analytics server including a processor and memory storing instructions that, in response to receiving an input from at least one data source, causes the processor to apply a set of process modules to the input to generate an input summary. The input summary includes a set of identified concepts and corresponding attributes of the input. The input includes background facts and causes the processor to select one or more ca...",
