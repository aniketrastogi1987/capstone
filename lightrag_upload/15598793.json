  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The invention offers a solution to the problems evoked previously, making it possible to sort action potentials in real time and in an unsupervised manner, that is to say without return of information as a function of the result of an output layer, in other words without feedback or inverse feedback, as in the case of reinforcement learning. One aspect of the invention relates to a method for unsupervised sorting, in real time, of action potentials of a plurality of biological neurons by means of a network of artificial neurons comprising an input layer, an intermediate layer and an output layer, each artificial neuron of the input layer being connected to a plurality of artificial neurons of the intermediate layer by a plurality of first excitatory synapses and each artificial neuron of the intermediate layer being connected to a plurality of artificial neurons of the output layer by a plurality of second excitatory synapses, at least one first or second excitatory synapse connecting a first artificial neuron to a second artificial neuron and having a weight that is modified as a function of the instants at which take place presynaptic spikes emitted by the first artificial neuron and postsynaptic spikes emitted by the second artificial neuron, method according to which: the input layer receives an electrical signal measuring an electrical activity of a plurality of biological neurons, the electrical signal having a variable amplitude as a function of action potentials emitted by the plurality of biological neurons over time; the input layer converts the amplitude of the electrical signal into a train of first spikes; the input layer transmits the train of first spikes to the intermediate layer; the intermediate layer converts the train of first spikes into a train of second spikes; the intermediate layer transmits the train of second spikes to the output layer; as a function of the train of second spikes, the output layer sorts ...",
