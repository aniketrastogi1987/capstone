  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This disclosure provides a system and method for performing fast computations using quantum counting. In a first embodiment, a method is provided for solving a computational problem that is reducible to a problem of counting solutions to an associated decision problem. The method includes, using a quantum computer, estimating a number of the solutions to the decision problem by determining if there is at least one simultaneous solution to both (i) the decision problem and (ii) an associated hashing problem. The method also includes, using the quantum computer, increasing a precision of the estimated number of the solutions to the decision problem by determining if there are multiple solutions to the decision problem that are simultaneously solutions to the associated hashing problem. The method further includes outputting or using the estimated number of the solutions to the decision problem as a solution to the computational problem. In a second embodiment, an apparatus includes a quantum computer having at least one quantum circuit. To solve a computational problem that is reducible to a problem of counting solutions to an associated decision problem, the quantum computer is configured to determine, using the at least one quantum circuit, if there is at least one simultaneous solution to both (i) the decision problem and (ii) an associated hashing problem in order to estimate a number of the solutions to the decision problem. The quantum computer is also configured to determine, using the at least one quantum circuit, if there are multiple solutions to the decision problem that are simultaneously solutions to the associated hashing problem in order to increase a precision of the estimated number of the solutions to the decision problem. The estimated number of the solutions to the decision problem represents a solution to the computational problem. In a third embodiment, a system includes a quantum computer having at least one quantum circuit an...",
