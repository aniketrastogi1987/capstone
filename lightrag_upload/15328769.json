  "abstract": "In some aspects, a mesoscopic system is used to generate entanglement, for example, on a pair of qubits. In some implementations, the mesoscopic system includes a first spin, a second spin and multiple other spins. The initial state of the first and second spins can be separable (non-entangled) states. Measurement outcomes are obtained by performing projective measurements on the mesoscopic system. Based on the measurement outcomes, an entangled state of the first and second spins is detected. The entangled state is transferred from the first and second spins to the first and second qubits.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In a general aspect, a mesoscopic system is used to generate entanglement on a pair of qubits. In some implementations, the mesoscopic system includes a first spin, a second spin and multiple other spins. The initial state of the first and second spins can be separable (non-entangled). Measurement outcomes are obtained by performing projective measurements on the mesoscopic system, and the projective measurements cause the first and second spins to become entangled. Based on the measurement outcomes, an entangled state of the first and second spins is detected. The entangled state is transferred from the first and second spins to the first and second qubits. The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",
