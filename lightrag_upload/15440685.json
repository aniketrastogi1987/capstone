  "abstract": "To provide an analysis apparatus capable of improving the accuracy of analysis results. An analysis apparatus makes predictions about the quality of conditions of a production facility or the quality of conditions of a production object in a process of producing a crankshaft as the production object by a grinder as the production facility. The analysis apparatus includes the plurality of predictors making predictions about the quality by using different analysis methods based on data concerning the production facility, a selection unit selecting the plurality of predictors in use from the plurality of predictors, and an overall predictor calculating a comprehensive prediction result about the quality based on the plurality of prediction results obtained by the plurality of predictors in use selected by the selection unit.",
