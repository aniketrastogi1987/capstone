  "abstract": "According to an embodiment, an image display device includes an image display unit, an optical sensor, and a control unit. The image display unit displays an image on a display screen using a display mechanism in which scanning is optically possible in a copy machine. The optical sensor is arranged on a plane including the display screen, and detects brightness of light with which the display screen is irradiated. The control unit changes display contents on the display screen to a predetermined display state when it is detected that the brightness of light with which the display screen is irradiated is at a predetermined threshold value or more in the optical sensor.",
