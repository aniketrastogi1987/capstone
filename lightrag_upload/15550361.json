  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>With respect to the defects occurring when the traditional extreme learning machine is applied to classification and regression, the present invention proposes an improved extreme learning machine method based on artificial bee colony optimization (DECABC-ELM) in view of the traditional extreme learning machine, which effectively increases the effects of classification and regression. The technical solution of the present invention is as follows: an improved extreme learning machine method based on artificial bee colony optimization comprises the following steps: given a training sample set (x i ,y i ) (i=1, 2, . . . , N), x i ∈R d , y i ∈R m , with an activation function of g( ), and the number of hidden nodes of L; Step 1, generating an initial solution for SN individuals as follows: in-line-formulae description=\"In-line Formulae\" end=\"lead\"? x i,j =x j min +rand[0,1]( x j max −x j min ),  (7) in-line-formulae description=\"In-line Formulae\" end=\"tail\"? wherein each individual is encoded in a manner as shown below: in-line-formulae description=\"In-line Formulae\" end=\"lead\"? θ G =[ω l,G T , . . . ,ω L,G T ,b l,G , . . . ,b L,G ]; in-line-formulae description=\"In-line Formulae\" end=\"tail\"? and during encoding, ωj(j=1, . . . , L) is a D-dimensional vector, with each dimension being a random number ranging from −1 to 1, b j is a random number ranging from 0 to 1, and G indicates an iteration number for a bee colony; Step 2, globally optimizing a connection weight ω and a threshold b for an extreme learning machine as follows: in-line-formulae description=\"In-line Formulae\" end=\"lead\"? v i,j =x ĩ,j +rand[−1,1]( x best,j −x k,j +x l,j −x m,j ),  (8) in-line-formulae description=\"In-line Formulae\" end=\"tail\"? wherein in formula (8), x best, j stands for a currently best individual in the bee colony, x k, j , x l, j and x m, j are another three different individuals chosen randomly other than the current individual, i.e, i≠k≠l≠m; wheneve...",
