  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to one embodiment of the invention, a method comprises the steps of receiving a set of process metrics, evaluating the set of received process metrics to determine a set of process classifications, determining a set of process parameters, and generating one or more processes based at least in part on the set of process parameters and the set of process classifications, each of the one or more processes having respective sets of process metrics similar to the set of received process metrics. The receiving, evaluating, determining and generating are performed by at least one processing device. According to another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture comprises a computer readable storage medium for storing computer readable program code. The computer readable program code, when executed, causes a computer to receive a set of process metrics, evaluate the set of received process metrics to determine a set of process classifications, determine a set of process parameters, and generate one or more processes based at least in part on the set of process parameters and the set of process classifications, each of the one or more processes having respective sets of process metrics similar to the set of received process metrics. According to another embodiment of the invention, an apparatus comprises a memory and a processor device operatively coupled to the memory. The processor device is configured to receive a set of process metrics, evaluate the set of received process metrics to determine a set of process classifications, determine a set of process parameters, and generate one or more processes based at least in part on the set of process parameters and the set of process classifications, each of the one or more processes having respective sets of process metrics similar to the set of received process metrics. These and other embodiments of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustra...",
