  "abstract": "A mechanism is provided in a data processing system for automatically generating question and answer pairs for training a question answering system for a given domain. The mechanism receives user input of question text for a question to be submitted to a question answering system in a user interface. The mechanism determines a question strength score for the question text. The question strength score represents a likelihood the question text will result in a correct answer with high confidence. The mechanism presents a graphical representation of the question strength score in the user interface.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one illustrative embodiment, a method, in a data processing system, is provided for presenting a question strength score for a question being asked of a question answering system. The method comprises receiving user input of question text for a question to be submitted to a question answering system in a user interface. The method further comprises determining a question strength score for the question text. The question strength score represents a likelihood the question text will result in a correct answer with high confidence. The method further comprises presenting a graphical representation of the question strength score in the user interface. In other illustrative embodiments, a computer program product comprising a computer useable or readable medium having a computer readable program is provided. The computer readable program, when executed on a computing device, causes the computing device to perform various ones of, and combinations of, the operations outlined above with regard to the method illustrative embodiment. In yet another illustrative embodiment, a system/apparatus is provided. The system/apparatus may comprise one or more processors and a memory coupled to the one or more processors. The memory may comprise instructions which, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform various ones of, and combinations of, the operations outlined above with regard to the method illustrative embodiment. These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be described in, or will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of, the following detailed description of the example embodiments of the present invention.",
