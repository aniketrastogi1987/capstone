  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present invention is directed towards methods for increasing the value of signal injections into a utility grid by receiving signal injection characteristics for a plurality of potential signal injections, receiving current sensor belief states, computing the learning value of each of the plurality of signal injections, selecting some of the plurality of potential signal injections based on the learning values, and implementing those selected signal injections.",

  "abstract": "Methods and systems for implementing experimental trials on utility grids. Variations in grid parameters are selected to introduce into utility grids to improve the value of learning from each experimental trial and promoting improved utility grid performance by computing expected values for both learning and grid performance. Those trials are used to manage the opportunity costs and constraints that affect the introduction of variations into utility grid parameters and the generation of valid data that can be attributed to particular variations in utility grid parameters.",
