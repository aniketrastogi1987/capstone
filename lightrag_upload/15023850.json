  "abstract": "Even when there is a large time lag between metrics of a target system, a decrease in analysis accuracy of the target system is prevented. An analysis apparatus (100) includes a processing unit (140) and pre-processing unit (130). The processing unit (140) performs comparative analysis of values of a first metric and a second metric in a system to be analyzed. The pre-processing unit (130) identifies, with respect to the comparative analysis of the first metric and the second metric, a temporal correspondence relation between respective pieces of data used as the first metric and the second metric.",
