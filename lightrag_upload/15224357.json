In other embodiments of the inventive subject matter, a system comprises a processor and a memory coupled to the processor and comprising computer readable program code embodied in the memory that is executable by the processor to perform: receiving a first document containing subject matter related to a course of action, the first document comprising a plurality of sub-documents that are related to one another in a time sequence; using a model comprising a topic sequence derived from a second document to generate a classification for the first document; and adjusting the course of action based on the classification for the first document. In further embodiments of the inventive subject matter, a computer program product comprises a tangible computer readable storage medium comprising computer readable program code embodied ...",
