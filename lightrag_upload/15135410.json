The method includes: constructing, by a server, an interest vector of a user according to a short-term interest, a long-term interest, and a group interest of the user, the interest vector of the user including multiple interest items; acquiring a candidate-for-recommendation question from a set of to-be-resolved questions according to the multiple interest items; estimating, according to a click-through rate (CTR) model, probability of answering the candidate-for-recommendation question by the user, and selecting a to-be-recommended question according to the estimated probability; and sending the to-be-recommended question to a client. In this way, a real-time comprehensive recommendation result can be obtained, and a question answering rate of an interactive question-and-answer platform can also be improved.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present disclosure provides a question recommending method, apparatus, and system, which can resolve problems in the prior art. An embodiment of the present invention provides a question recommending method, including: constructing, by a server, an interest vector of a user according to a short-term interest, a long-term interest, and a group interest of the user, the interest vector of the user including multiple interest items; acquiring at least one candidate-for-recommendation question from a set of to-be-resolved questions according to the multiple interest items; estimating, according to a click-through rate (CTR) model, a probability of answering the candidate-for-recommendation question by the user, and selecting a to-be-recommended question from the at least one candidate-for-recommendation question according to the estimated probability; and recommending the to-be-recommended question to a client of the user. An embodiment of the present invention provides a question recommending apparatus, including: an interest vector calculation module, configured to construct an interest vector of a user according to a short-term interest, a long-term interest, and a group interest of the user, the interest vector of the user including multiple interest items; a candidate-for-recommendation question acquiring module, configured to acquire at least one candidate-for-recommendation question from a set of to-be-resolved questions according to the multiple interest items; a to-be-recommended question acquiring module, configured to estimate, according to a CTR model, a probability of answering the candidate-for-recommendation question by the user, and select a to-be-recommended question from the at least one candidate-for-recommendation question according to the estimated probability; and a question recommending module, configured to recommend the to-be-recommended question to a client of the user. An embodiment of the present invention provides a qu...",
