  "abstract": "A system for predicting events by associating time series data with other types of non-time series data can include a processor configured to receive a data stream including time series data transmitted from a sensor configured to measure an operating parameter of a component being monitored. The processor identifies sequences of interest in the time series data having predictive value. The processor compares the real-time data stream to a set of known historical patterns that act as effective leading indicators of different alarms and events. The processor extracts any identified sequences of interest from the time series data as an extracted event. The processor quantifies the relationship between the data of the extracted event and the known historical pattern by calculating a confidence level to denote a probability of occurrence of the event by comparing how closely the new time series data matches the data patterns associated with known events.",

  "summary": "<SOH> III. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In at least one aspect, the present disclosure provides a system for predicting events by associating time series data with other types of data. This system can include a processing unit configured to receive a data stream including time series data transmitted from a sensor configured to measure an operating parameter of a component being monitored. The processing unit analyzes the data stream to identify a sequence of interest in the time series data. The processing unit extracts the identified sequence of interest from the time series data as an extracted event. The processing unit quantifies the relationship between the time series data of the extracted event and the known event by calculating a confidence level to denote a statistical probability of occurrence of the event by comparing data patterns of the extracted event with data of the template pattern of the known event.",
