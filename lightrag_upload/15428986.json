  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An objective of the present application is to provide an improved method and appratus for monitoring a system, in order to solve the technical problem mentioned in the Background section. In a first aspect, the present application provides a method for monitoring a system comprising: acquiring status index data series of a monitored system during at least one data collection period, as historical status index data series; introducing the historical status index data series into a pre-trained recommended feature extraction model to perform a matching operation, to obtain a feature extraction algorithm matched with the historical status index data series as a recommended feature extraction algorithm, wherein the recommended feature extraction model characterizes a corresponding relationship between the status index data series and the obtained feature extraction algorithm; determining a maximum value and a minimum value of feature values obtained by performing feature extraction on the historical status index data series according to the recommended feature extraction algorithm; determining, based on the determined maximum value and minimum value, a normal value range of feature values obtained by performing feature extraction on status index data series of the monitored system according to the recommended feature extraction algorithm; and monitoring the monitored system according to the recommended feature extraction algorithm and the normal value range. In a second aspect, the present application provides an apparatus for monitoring a system comprising: an acquisition unit, configured to acquire status index data series, of a monitored system during at least one data collection period, as historical status index data series; a matching unit, configured to introduce the historical status index data series into a pre-trained recommended feature extraction model to perform a matching operation, to obtain a feature extraction algorithm matched with th...",
