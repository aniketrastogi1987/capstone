In one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided comprising: receiving, by one or more computer processors, an input/output (I/O) request, wherein the received I/O request includes an associated importance level for performing the received I/O request by a storage controller; responsive to determining that a base device is not available to handle the received I/O request, determining, by one or more computer processors, whether the received I/O request is eligible for performance throttling based, at least in part, on the associated importance level for performing the received I/O request and one or more characteristics of the received I/O request; and transmitting, by one or more computer processors, the received I/O request to the storage controller with an indication of whether the received I/O request is eligible for performance throttling.",
