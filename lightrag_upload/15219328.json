  "abstract": "Systems and methods for monitoring and assessing crop health and performance can provide rapid screening of individual plants. The systems and methods have an automated component, and rely primarily on the detection and interpretation of plant-based signals to provide information about crop health. In some cases knowledge from human experts is captured and integrated into the automated crop monitoring systems and methods. Predictive models can also be developed and used to predict future health of plants in a crop.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In one aspect, a method for assessing a state of plants in a crop comprises a training phase and an assessment phase. The training phase comprises: receiving human expert assessment of the state of each plant of a first plurality of plants; receiving training sensor data captured for each plant of the first plurality of plants, the training sensor data related to at least one plant-related parameter; and correlating the human expert assessment with the training sensor data to generate a set of trained data and a data-derived model based on the set of training data. The assessment phase comprises: receiving crop assessment sensor data captured for each plant of a second plurality of plants in the crop, the crop assessment sensor data related to at least one plant-related parameter; classifying a state of each plant of the second plurality of plants based by applying the data-derived model to the crop assessment sensor data; and transmitting information relating to the state of plants in the second plurality of plants to at least one end-user device. The first plurality of plants may or may not be part of the same crop that contains the second plurality of plants, although the first and second plurality of plants are generally of the same type. In some embodiments of the method, the human expert assessment and the training sensor data are captured and transmitted by a hand-held sensory device operated by the human expert. The end-use device(s) to which information is transmitted may comprise the hand-held device. In some embodiments of the method, at least some of the crop assessment sensor data is captured and transmitted by a mobile sensory platform comprising at least one sensor positioned proximate to each plant during capture of crop assessment sensor data for that plant. In some embodiments of the method, at least some of the crop assessment sensor data is captured and transmitted by a hand-held device operated by a worker at ...",
