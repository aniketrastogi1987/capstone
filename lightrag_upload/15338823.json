  "abstract": "Race car settings (e.g., Formula 1 engine mix settings) are developed for particular racing goals such as faster lap time, better acceleration, less vehicle wear, etc., using pattern templates that are derived from historical racing scenarios. The historical scenarios provide data on racing settings, racing results, and racing conditions such as squad information, equipment information, and environmental information. A cognitive (deep question answering) system can select an initial pattern template based on current racing conditions, and present suggested vehicle settings to the user (driver) using the initial pattern template. The driver can select from different candidate values for various factors, which may lead to the presentation of additional suggestions or the use of additional pattern templates. The final settings map is created based on the employed pattern templates and the driver selections.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The present invention in at least one embodiment is generally directed to developing a racing strategy for vehicle settings by receiving a plurality of racing scenarios from a racing data repository wherein each racing scenario includes racing conditions, racing vehicle settings, and racing results, analyzing the racing scenarios to associate specific racing vehicle settings with certain racing conditions and optimal racing results, and creating a pattern template for one or more racing goals based on the specific racing vehicle settings and certain racing conditions. The racing goals can be for example faster lap time, better acceleration, less vehicle wear, better fuel economy, more stability, and improved cornering. Racing conditions can include items such as squad information, equipment information, and environmental information. In some embodiments, the pattern template includes a set of filters, a set of suggestions for the racing vehicle settings, or a factor having multiple candidate settings. The settings can for example include an engine mix setting specifying an air-to-fuel ratio. The above as well as additional objectives, features, and advantages in the various embodiments of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.",
