In one embodiment, by way of example only, a method for accurate temporal event predictive modeling by a processor is provided. An average reverse event delay may be determined from one or more event delays in a time-series window. A time-series event may be predicted by applying the average reverse event delay in conjunction with one or more weighted factors in a predictive model.",
