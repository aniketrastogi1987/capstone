  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>This invention has an object to achieve rapid and accurate data analysis. An aspect of the invention disclosed in this application is a data analysis apparatus, which is executed by a processor capable of accessing a storage device, the processor being configured to execute: first acquisition processing of acquiring a group of learning input data, which is a set of learning input data that contains values of a plurality of first data items, from the storage device; first setting processing of setting a plurality of first hash functions by generating first hash tables, which are independent of one another; first calculation processing of substituting each learning input data of the group of learning input data acquired by the first acquisition processing in each of the plurality of first hash functions set by the first setting processing, to thereby calculate a plurality of first hash values corresponding to the values of the plurality of first data items for each of the plurality of first hash functions; first selection processing of selecting, for the group of learning input data and for each of the plurality of first hash functions, a specific first hash value that satisfies a predetermined statistical condition from among the plurality of first hash values, which have been calculated for each of the plurality of first hash functions by the first calculation processing; second setting processing of setting a second hash function by generating a second hash table; second calculation processing of substituting, for the group of learning input data, each specific first hash value, which has been selected for each of the plurality of first hash functions by the first selection processing, in the second hash function set by the second setting processing, to thereby calculate a plurality of second hash values; and first generation processing of generating a learning feature vector that indicates features of the group of learning input...",
