  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>One goal of the present invention is to provide an interactive image device that integrates a presented image with interactive effects, also provide an interactive method for manual operation of users to solve problems above. In one exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides an interactive image device, at least comprising: a frame, provided with at least one fastening position, a housing space inside the frame and at least one display surface for presenting at least one image; an effect unit, arranged along the edge of the frame or inside the frame, for producing at least one effect; a circuit module, arranged in the housing space, at least comprising a control unit, a switch unit and a memory unit, wherein the control unit is electrically connected to the effect unit, the switch unit and the memory unit, and wherein the switch unit comprises at least one switch; and a trigger unit, wherein at one end of the trigger unit is provided with at least one trigger portion for mating with the at least one switch so that the switch unit generates a setting signal or a start signal according to the on or off state of the at least one switch respectively, and wherein: When the trigger unit is located in the fastening position, the at least one trigger portion makes the at least one switch in a first switch state so that the switch unit generates the setting signal and outputs the setting signal to the control unit, wherein the control unit generates a storage value in accordance with the setting signal, saves the storage value in the memory unit and selectively disables the effect unit to stop producing the at least one effect ; and when the trigger unit is not located in the fastening position, the at least one trigger portion makes the at least one switch in a second switch state so that the switch unit generates the start signal and outputs the start signal to the control unit, wherein the control unit reads the storage ...",
