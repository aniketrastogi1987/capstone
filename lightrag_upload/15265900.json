  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In general, example embodiments of the present disclosure include a method, device and computer program product for in-memory caching. In one aspect, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a computer-implemented method. In the method, a pinned memory space for caching data is provided in a data node, where the data that is cached in the pinned memory space is prevented from being swapped out. Then, a virtual address is assigned to the data, and the virtual address is mapped to a memory address of the data in the pinned memory space for accessing the data by an application. In another aspect, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a device. The device comprises a processing unit; and a tangible storage medium having instructions stored thereon for execution by the processing unit, the instructions, when executed by the processing unit, cause the device to perform a method. In the method, a pinned memory space for caching data is provided in a data node, where the data that is cached in the pinned memory space is prevented from being swapped out. Then, a virtual address is assigned to the data, and the virtual address is mapped to a memory address of the data in the pinned memory space for accessing the data by an application. In yet another aspect, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith. The program instructions executable by a device to cause the device to provide in a data node a pinned memory space for caching data, where the data that is cached in the pinned memory space is prevented from being swapped out; and assign a virtual address to the data, where the virtual address is mapped to a memory address of the data in the pinned memory space for accessing the data by an application. It is to be understood that the Summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of embodiments of the present d...",
