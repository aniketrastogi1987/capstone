  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Provided is a method for processing a query in a Q&A system and ranking search results based on speech pattern detection. The method comprises, in response to the query, identifying, using a processor of a computer, search results comprising items from multiple items and ranking the search results based on a confidence score associated with each of the items from the multiple items. The confidence score is generated for each of the items by detecting speech characteristics of the item, determining a hesitation level of the item based on the speech characteristics, and generating a confidence score based on the hesitation level. Provided is a computer program product for processing a query in a Q&A system and ranking search results based on speech pattern detection. The computer program product comprises a computer readable storage medium having program code embodied therewith, the program code executable by at least one processor to perform operations comprising: in response to the query, identifying search results comprising items from multiple items and ranking the search results based on a confidence score associated with each of the items from the multiple items. The confidence score is generated for each of the items by detecting speech characteristics of the item, determining a hesitation level of the item based on the speech characteristics, and generating a confidence score based on the hesitation level. Provided is a computer system for processing a query in a Q&A system and ranking search results based on speech pattern detection. The computer system comprises one or more processors, one or more computer-readable memories and one or more computer-readable, tangible storage devices; and program instructions, stored on at least one of the one or more computer-readable, tangible storage devices for execution by at least one of the one or more processors via at least one of the one or more memories, to perform operations comprising: in respo...",
