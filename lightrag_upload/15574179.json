  "abstract": "Examples disclosed herein relate, among other things, to a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium encoded with instructions executable by a processor of a computing device to cause the computing device to obtain data from a plurality of sensors of at least a first type and a second type. The instructions may also cause the computing device to determine, for each sensor of the second type, whether the data obtained from the sensor of the second type is reliable based at least on the data obtained from a sensor of the first type that is associated with the sensor of the second type.",
