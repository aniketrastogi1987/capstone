  "abstract": "An output buffer holds N words arranged as N/J mutually exclusive output buffer word groups (OBWG) of J words each. N processing units (PU) are arranged as N/J mutually exclusive PU groups each having an associated OBWG. Each PU has an accumulator, arithmetic unit, and first and second multiplexed registers each having at least J+1 inputs. A first input receives a memory operand and the other J inputs receive the J words of the associated OBWG. Each accumulator provides its output to a respective OBWG. Each arithmetic unit performs an operation on the first and second multiplexed register outputs and accumulator output to generate a result for accumulation into the accumulator. A mask input to the output buffer controls which words, if any, of the N words retain their current value or are updated with their respective accumulator output. Each PU group operates as a recurrent neural network LSTM cell.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a processor that includes a neural network unit (NNU). FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a NPU of FIG. 1 . FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the arrangement of the N mux-regs of the N NPUs of the NNU of FIG. 1 to illustrate their operation as an N-word rotater, or circular shifter, for a row of data words received from the data RAM of FIG. 1 . FIG. 4 is a table illustrating a program for storage in the program memory of and execution by the NNU of FIG. 1 . FIG. 5 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 4 by the NNU. FIG. 6A is a block diagram illustrating the NNU of FIG. 1 to execute the program of FIG. 4 . FIG. 6B is a flowchart illustrating operation of the processor of FIG. 1 to perform an architectural program that uses the NNU to perform multiply-accumulate-activation function computations classically associated with neurons of hidden layers of an artificial neural network such as performed by the program of FIG. 4 . FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating a NPU of FIG. 1 according to an alternate embodiment. FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a NPU of FIG. 1 according to an alternate embodiment. FIG. 9 is a table illustrating a program for storage in the program memory of and execution by the NNU of FIG. 1 . FIG. 10 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 9 by the NNU. FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the NNU of FIG. 1 is shown. In the embodiment of FIG. 11 , a neuron is split into two portions, the activation function unit portion and the ALU portion (which also includes the shift register portion), and each activation function unit portion is shared by multiple ALU portions. FIG. 12 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 4 by the NNU of FIG. 11 . FIG. 13 is a timing diagram illustrating the execution of the program of FIG. 4 by the N...",
