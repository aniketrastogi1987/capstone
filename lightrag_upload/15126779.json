  "abstract": "Allowable ranges of various characteristics in a system can be efficiently adjusted. An operation management apparatus (100) includes a correlation model storage unit (112) and an analysis unit (103). The correlation model storage unit (112) stores a correlation model which is based on a relation between different metrics among a plurality of metrics in a system. The analysis unit (103), when a new allowable range is set for one metric of the plurality of metrics, extracts and outputs, as a new allowable range for a metric for which an allowable range is to be changed, an allowable range satisfying a predicted variable range of the metric from a plurality of allowable ranges settable for the metric, based on the correlation model.",
