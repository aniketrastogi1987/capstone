  "abstract": "Systems and methods for understanding (inputing meaning to) multi model data streams may be used in intelligent surveillance and allow a) real-time integration of streaming data from video, audio, infrared and other sensors; b) processing of the results of such integration to obtain understanding of the situation as it unfolds; c) assessing the level of threat inherent in the situation; and d) generating of warning advisories delivered to appropriate recipients as necessary for mitigating the threat. The system generates understanding of the system by creating and manipulating models of the situation as it unfolds. The creation and manipulation involve “neuronal packets” formed in mutually constraining associative networks of four basic types. The process is thermodynamically driven, striving to produce a minimal number of maximally stable models. Obtaining such models is experienced as grasping, or understanding the input steam (objects, their relations and the flow of changes).",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The level of understanding accomplished by Machine Intelligence and other disciplines dedicated to image understanding has previously been limited to identifying and recognizing individual objects in the image. By contrast, human understanding does not stop at recognizing objects but extends to hypothesizing relationships between objects and reconstructing the overall situation, as manifested in the image or sequences of images. Moreover, situational understanding is facilitated when visual information is combined with inputs in other sensory modalities. Understanding involves composition of mental models that enable predicting possible future changes in the situation as well as retrodicting earlier conditions from which the present situation could have developed. Systems and methods that emulate understanding mechanisms in the humans and allow reconstructing complex situations from multi modal data streams will find applications in intelligent monitoring, cyber warfare and other areas. Another class of applications involves dynamic structuring of information displays in human-machine systems for the purpose of facilitating operator understanding of complex dynamic situations and enabling robust decision making in real time. Human cognition has evolved to optimize performance in fluid and complex environments. Unlike in a photograph or other fixed images, objects and conditions in the environment are not frozen in time but undergo continuous changes. As a result, understanding an image is not restricted to recognizing objects but involves mentally complementing the present fixed image with a series of other images reflecting conditions that are likely to precede and follow those in the image. That is, understanding is contingent on creating mental models capable of predicting future and retrodicting past conditions so that the present image can be seen as capturing some intermediate stage in an unfolding situation.
