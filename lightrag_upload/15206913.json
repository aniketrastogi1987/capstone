  "abstract": "In some examples, systems and techniques can determine a respective visit likelihood for each respective destination of a plurality of destinations based at least in part on a respective distance between the respective destination and a geographic location from a location history associated with a user and a comparison between a time associated with the geographic location and a visit likelihood distribution across time. The systems and techniques can then sort at least some of the plurality of destinations. In other examples, systems and techniques can determine whether a user is likely to visit a place during a future instance of a timeslot based at least in part on a location history associated with the user. The systems and techniques can then output information relating to the place prior to the beginning of the future instance of the timeslot.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one example, the disclosure describes a method including determining, by a computing system, information associated with a plurality of destinations proximate to a geographic location from a location history associated with a user, the geographic location being associated with a time, the information associated with the plurality of destinations including, for each respective destination of the plurality of destinations, at least a name of the respective destination and a respective distance between the respective destination and the geographic location. The method also can include, for each respective destination of the plurality of destinations, determining, by the computing system, based at least in part on 1) the respective distance between the respective destination and the geographic location and 2) a comparison between the time associated with the geographic location and a visit likelihood distribution across time, a visit likelihood associated with the respective destination. Additionally, the method can include sorting, by the computing system and based at least in part on the visit likelihood associated with the respective destination, a portion of the plurality of destinations; and outputting, by the computing system, an indication of the portion of the plurality of destinations. In another example, the disclosure describes a computer-readable storage device storing instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor of a computing device to determine, based at least in part on a plurality of proximate geographical location data points from a location history associated with a user, a geographic location for a visit having a visit start time and a visit end time. The computer-readable storage device can also store instructions that, when executed, cause the at least one processor of the computing device to determine information associated with a plurality of destinations proximate to the geographic location, the informatio...",
