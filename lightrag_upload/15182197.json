  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to an embodiment, a method for a software vendor to proactively identify problems a customer may have with software procured from the software vendor is disclosed. The method includes: inputting into a data set, by a processor, customer data having customer identifying data and customer-satisfaction data related to customer satisfaction with the software; constructing, by the processor, a mathematical model that is configured to model first quantitative customer-satisfaction attributes in the customer-satisfaction data; applying, by the processor, one or more robustness analytic processes to the mathematical model to determine a robustness value that quantifies robustness of the mathematical model; determining, by the processor, if the robustness value of the mathematical model meets or exceeds a robustness threshold value; applying, by the processor, one or more significance analytic processes to the modeled first quantitative customer-satisfaction attributes to determine a significance value that quantifies statistical significance of the quantified customer-satisfaction attributes in response to the robustness value of the mathematical model meeting or exceeding a robustness threshold value; sending, by the processor, a notification having the quantified customer-satisfaction attributes to a subject matter expert in response to the significance value being less than or equal to a significance threshold value and the quantified customer-satisfaction attributes express dissatisfaction with the software; receiving, by the processor, from the subject matter expert a remedial plan to improve the quantified customer-satisfaction attributes; and implementing, by the processor, the remedial plan by at least one of modifying the software to provide modified software, modifying a configuration of the software to provide a modified configuration, and modifying an implementation plan for implementing the software to provide a modified implementat...",
