  "abstract": "A computer-implemented method includes receiving a rule, wherein the rule includes at least one token, and receiving at least two dictionaries, wherein the at least two dictionaries include at least one general language dictionary and at least one domain-specific dictionary for a domain. The computer-implemented method further includes, for each of the at least one token, selecting at least one word at random from at least one of the at least two dictionaries and adding the at least one word to a test data line, such that the test data line includes a candidate statement conforming to the rule. The computer-implemented method further includes filtering the candidate statement based on a domain-specific model for the domain and including the candidate statement in training data provided to a machine learning model. A corresponding computer program product and computer system are also disclosed.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A computer-implemented method includes receiving a rule, wherein the rule includes at least one token, and receiving at least two dictionaries, wherein the at least two dictionaries include at least one general language dictionary and at least one domain-specific dictionary for a domain. The computer-implemented method further includes, for each of the at least one token, selecting at least one word at random from at least one of the at least two dictionaries and adding the at least one word to a test data line, such that the test data line includes a candidate statement conforming to the rule. The computer-implemented method further includes filtering the candidate statement based on a domain-specific model for the domain and including the candidate statement in training data provided to a machine learning model. A corresponding computer program product and computer system are also disclosed. Such a method according to the invention is advantaged at least in that it provides for generating training data for machine learning where only limited or no training data is available. In an aspect, the computer-implemented method further includes inserting at least one additional word randomly selected from at least one of the at least two dictionaries into the test data line. A method according to this aspect is advantaged at least in that it provides a robust corpus that includes varied positive test cases. In an aspect, filtering the candidate statement includes discarding the candidate statement, if the candidate statement is nonsensical for the domain, according to the domain-specific model. A method according to this aspect is advantaged at least in that it provides trimming the generated training set based on valid combinations of domain-specific words.",
