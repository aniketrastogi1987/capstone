  "abstract": "Methods and system pertaining to modifying a diagnostic flowchart are described. A method can include (i) receiving, from a diagnostic computing device, a request indicative of a vehicle problem, (ii) selecting a first diagnostic flowchart associated with the vehicle problem from a plurality of diagnostic flowcharts. Each diagnostic flowchart includes one or more ordered and performable path elements, where each path element leads to one or more ordered decision elements, where each path element comprises one or more diagnostic steps. The method also includes (iii) sending the first diagnostic flowchart for performance at a diagnostic computing device, (iv) determining first feedback data associated with a performance of the first diagnostic flowchart at the diagnostic computing device, and (v) modifying the first diagnostic flowchart based at least on the first feedback data.",
