  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An approach is provided that receives, over a computer network, transaction data from a number of clients that are running an app. The approach generates association rules by inputting the transaction data to an association rule learning algorithm, such as an Apriori algorithm. Each association rule is based on a user transaction pattern and a desired result, and each association rule includes a generated confidence value that pertains to an expected performance of one of the steps included in the respective association rule. The app is then modified based on an analysis of the generated confidence values, with the app modification being directed towards improving one or more of the confidence values. The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent in the non-limiting detailed description set forth below.",
