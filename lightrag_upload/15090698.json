  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present invention provides a method and associated system and associated computer program product. A server computer selects a re-ordering scheme from one or more re-ordering schemes, for re-ordering chunks of an original file. The server computer divides the file into the chunks. After the file is divided into the chunks, the server computer re-orders the chunks according to the selected re-ordering scheme to form an obfuscated file that includes the re-ordered chunks. The server computer sends, to a client computer, the obfuscated file along with a scheme access reference that enables the client computer to access the selected re-ordering scheme.",
