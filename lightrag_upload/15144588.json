  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>The example embodiments provide methods and systems for data property-based data placement inside a nonvolatile memory device performed by a storage controller of the nonvolatile memory device. In one aspect, the embodiments include: executing a software component on the computer device that detects at least one of an executing application and a hardware device connecting to the computing device; responsive to detecting the at least one executing application and the hardware device, searching, by the software component, a workflow repository to find a predetermined workflow associated with the at least one executing application and the hardware device, wherein the predetermined workflow associates predefined data property identifiers to different types of data items written to the nonvolatile memory device by the executing application or the hardware device; comparing, by the software component, activities of the at least one executing application and the hardware device to the predetermined workflow; and using the predetermined workflow to automatically assign the data property identifiers to the data items used by the application or the hardware device, such that the data items and assigned data property identifiers are transmitted over a channel to the nonvolatile memory device for storage wherein the nonvolatile memory device reads the data property identifiers and identifies which blocks of the nonvolatile memory device to store the corresponding data items, such that the data items having the same data property identifiers are stored in a same block. The example embodiments also include a system, comprising: a nonvolatile memory device; and a computer device coupled to the nonvolatile memory device. The computer device executes a software component serving as an interface for enabling the computer device to utilize data property-based data placement inside the nonvolatile memory device. The software component is configured to: detect a...",
