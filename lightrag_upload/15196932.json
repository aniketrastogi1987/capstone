  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the present invention provide a method for processing information by an intelligent agent and the intelligent agent, where information on a social network may be learned and processed by means of interaction with another intelligent agent, thereby implementing mining of data on the social network. According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a method for processing information by an intelligent agent, including: sending, by a first intelligent agent, a request message to a second intelligent agent, where the request message includes an invitation message or a recommendation message sent to the second intelligent agent; receiving, by the first intelligent agent, a decision message fed back by the second intelligent agent, where the decision message is a message that is determined by the second intelligent agent according to the invitation message or the recommendation message and a knowledge model of the second intelligent agent; and updating, by the first intelligent agent according to the decision message, a knowledge model of the first intelligent agent or sending, by the first intelligent agent according to the decision message, a notification message to a first user account corresponding to the first intelligent agent. In a first possible embodiment, with reference to the first aspect, the sending, by a first intelligent agent, a request message to a second intelligent agent includes: sending, by the first intelligent agent, the request message to the second intelligent agent at any moment; or predicting, by the first intelligent agent, an idle time of a second user account by learning a historical posting time of the second user account, and sending, by the first intelligent agent, the request message to the second intelligent agent at the idle time of the second user account, where the second user account corresponds to the second intelligent agent. In a second possible embodiment, with reference to the first as...",
