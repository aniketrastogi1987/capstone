  "abstract": "In social data networks, it is difficult for a computing system to automatically identify demographic attributes associated with user accounts because of incorrect, incomplete or non-existent data associated with the user account profile. Therefore, a computing system is provided that retrieves user account data and related text data, and that uses Deep Learning computations to infer demographic attributes about a given user based on the text data that they generate. The text is processed, and then inputted into a bi-gram neural network to generate an initial feature vector. This initial feature vector is inputted into a Deep Learning neural network in order to generate a secondary feature vector. The secondary feature vector is inputted into a forward neural network to generate one or more values indicating a specific demographic attribute associated with the given user account.",
