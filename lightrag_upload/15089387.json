  "abstract": "The present disclosure pertains to a system and method for predictive modeling of data clusters. The system and method include creating a dataset from a data source comprising data points, identifying a number of clusters based at least in part on a similarity metric between the data points, generating a model for each of the number of clusters based at least in part on identifying the number of clusters, visually displaying the number of clusters, receiving an indication of selection of a particular cluster, and replacing the visual display of the identified number of clusters with a visual display of the model corresponding to the particular cluster in response to receiving an indication of selection of a model icon.",
