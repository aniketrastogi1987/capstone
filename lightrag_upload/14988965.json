  "abstract": "Methods, computing systems and computer program products implement embodiments of the present invention that include identifying a set of storage services on multiple storage systems. A plurality of storage services are defined, each of the storage services comprising a subset of the storage resources, and a defined storage (SDS) system is configured comprising the defined storage services. Multiple sub consistency groups are configured, each of the sub consistency group comprising one or more logical volumes stored in a subset of the defined storage services on a given storage system, and a consistency group is configured comprising the multiple sub consistency groups. Upon detecting a snapshot condition, processing input/output operations to all the volumes in the sub consistency groups can be simultaneously suspended, a snapshot for each of the sub consistency groups is generated, and the processing of the input/output operations is resumed upon generating the respective snapshots.",
