  "abstract": "In some examples, a method includes accessing input vectors in an input space, wherein the input vectors characterize elements of a physical system. The method may also include generating feature vectors from the input vectors, and the feature vectors are generated without any vector product operations between performed between any of the input vectors. An inner product of a pair of the feature vectors may correlate to an implicit kernel for the pair of feature vectors, and the implicit kernel may approximate a Gaussian kernel within a difference threshold. The method may further include providing the feature vectors to an application engine for use in analyzing the elements of the physical system, other elements in the physical system, or a combination of both.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>Certain examples are described in the following detailed description and in reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 shows an example of a system that supports generation of feature vectors using concomitant rank order (CRO) hash sets. FIG. 2 shows an example of an architecture that supports generation of feature vectors using CRO hash sets. FIG. 3 shows an example graph to illustrate how an implicit kernel may differ from a Gaussian kernel by less than a difference threshold. FIG. 4 shows a flow chart of an example method for feature vector generation. FIG. 5 shows a flow chart of another example method for feature vector generation. FIG. 6 shows an example of a system that supports generation of feature vectors using CRO hash sets. detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?",
