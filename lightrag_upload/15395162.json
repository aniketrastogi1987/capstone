  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In an embodiment, an interior test fit system for automatically creating floor plan layouts is disclosed. The interior test fit system uses a computer having a memory, a central processing unit, and a display, the memory containing instructions that, when executed by the central processing unit, perform steps comprising obtaining client parameters, a room library, and a tile library as inputs, determining a set of selected rooms from the room library, the set defined as a function of room contents and client parameters, determining a set of selected tiles from the tile library, the set defined as a function of tile designs and the room attributes of the set of selected room, and determining a placement of the set of tiles within a floor plan layout, the placement defined as a function of tile attributes of the selected tiles and building shell attributes. In a second embodiment, client parameters define a percentage of the floor plan layout to be occupied by at least one mode. In another embodiment, the function of room contents and client parameters is a function such that the total percentage of area in the set of selected rooms allocated to at least one mode is equal to or greater than the total percentage of floor plan area to be allocated to the at least one mode as defined by the client parameters. In another embodiment, the function of tile designs and the room attributes of the set of selected rooms is a function such that all of the rooms in the space program can be placed within tiles in the set of selected tiles given the tile designs of the selected tiles and the selected tiles can be arranged in a manner which satisfies circulation constraints. In another embodiment, the function of tile attributes of the selected tiles and building shell attributes is a function such that the selected tiles do not overlap while placement requirements are satisfied. In another embodiment, a method for automatically creating floor plan layouts is discl...",
