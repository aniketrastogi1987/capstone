  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. The summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is neither intended to identify key or critical elements of the disclosure nor to delineate the scope of the disclosure. The following summary merely presents some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the description below. Aspects of the disclosure relate to methods, computer-readable media, and apparatuses for determining and implementing risk unit based insurance policies. In some arrangements, a user may receive a plurality of risk units associated with an insurance policy, such as an auto insurance policy. The risk units may be stored in a risk unit account associated with the user, the vehicle, etc. During operation of the vehicle, sensor data may be received. The sensor data may provide information associated with driving behaviors of the user, environmental conditions in which the vehicle is being operated, and the like. A consumption rate of the risk units may be determined based, at least in part, on the received sensor data. Consumption rate may also be based on additional factors, such as driving experience, policy coverage, vehicle features, and the like. In some examples, the consumption rate may be based on a combination of factors or on only sensor data factors or only other factors not determined based on sensor data. Accordingly, as the vehicle is operated, a number or balance of risk units in the risk unit account may be reduced based on the determined consumption rate. In some examples, a determination may be made as to whether a number or balance of risk units in the risk unit account is below a predetermined threshold. If so, a notification may be transmitted to the user. In some arrangements, the notification may include a request for user input to purchase additional risk units (e.g., a request for user input identif...",
