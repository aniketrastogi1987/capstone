  "abstract": "A probabilistic inference system is provided with: a pre-modification model input unit that receives the input of a probabilistic inference model; a model modification execution unit that outputs a modified probabilistic inference model; an inference calculation cost estimation unit that calculates a calculation cost when a probabilistic inference process is performed; an inference error estimation unit that estimates the magnitude of inference error that could be caused in a certain designated random variable in the probabilistic inference model when the probabilistic inference process is performed using the modified probabilistic inference model, compared with when the probabilistic inference process is performed using the probabilistic inference model; an adopted model selection unit that selects the probabilistic inference model to be adopted based on a probabilistic inference condition regarding the calculation cost and the inference error; and a modified model output unit that ou...",
