  "abstract": "A method of generating mapping dictionaries for neural networks may be provided. A method may include receiving, at a current layer, encoded activation addresses from a previous layer and encoded weight addresses. The method may also include decoding the encoded activation addresses to generate decoded activation addresses, and decoding the encoded weight addresses to generate decoded weight addresses. Further, the method may include generating original activation addresses from the decoded activation addresses and the decoded weight addresses. Moreover, the method may include matching the original activation addresses to a mapping dictionary to generate encoded activation addresses for the current layer.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>One or more embodiments of the present disclosure may include methods of generating mapping dictionaries for a neural network. According to one embodiment, a method may include receiving, at a current layer, encoded activation addresses from a previous layer and encoded weight addresses. The method may also include decoding the encoded activation addresses to generate decoded activation addresses. Further, the method may include decoding the encoded weight addresses to generate decoded weight addresses. In addition, the method may include generating original activation addresses from the decoded activation addresses and the decoded weight addresses. Moreover, the method may include matching the original activation addresses to a mapping dictionary to generate encoded activation addresses for the current layer. The object and advantages of the embodiments will be realized and achieved at least by the elements, features, and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims. Both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive.",
