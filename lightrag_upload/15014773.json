  "abstract": "A machine learning classifier system includes a data set processing subsystem to generate a training set and a validation set from multiple data sources. Classifier hardware induces a classifier according to the training set, and tests the classifier according to the validation set. A buffer connected to the classifier hardware stores data objects to be classified, and a register connected to the classifier hardware stores outputs of the classifier, including classified data objects.",
