  "abstract": "Embodiments include an improved database logging system where transactions are allocated to multiple different partitions of a database log file and log records for transactions are written to different partitions of a database log. Each partition can store log records for a separate transaction in a separate log cache memory. Writing log records to a page of the database log can be prevented until previous log records modifying that same page have been written to disk. A sequential timestamp that is unique across the plurality of partitions may be assigned to the log records for this purpose, and a log record containing a modification to a page can be flushed after previous modifications to the page have been written to disk. Restore operations can then be performed by copying the log records of the multiple partitions into a priority data structure and ordered into a merged list based on timestamp.",
