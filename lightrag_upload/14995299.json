  "abstract": "A simulation apparatus according to one embodiment, including: an event receiver, a decision maker and an execution command transmitter. The event receiver receives an event showing a situation of a first monitor target simulated by a first simulator simulating at least one of motion and state change of the first monitor target from a monitor apparatus monitoring a simulation of the first simulator. The decision maker determines an action based on the event, the action to be carried out with respect to a second monitor target undergoing a simulation of at least one of motion and state change by a second simulator synchronized with the first simulator by time progress. The execution command transmitter transmits an execution command of the action determined by the decision maker to a control apparatus controlling the second simulator.",
