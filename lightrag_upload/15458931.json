  "abstract": "Systems and methods for predicting the outcome of a business entity are presented. In embodiments, a system may receive explicit data reporting or indicating activities of a business entity, and other data from which information regarding the activities or level of operations of the entity may be inferred. Using one or more data processors, the system may generate inferred data regarding the business entity from a selected portion of the other data, and use at least some of the explicit data and the inferred data to determine which one of a series of defined sequential active states of development the entity currently is in. The system may further, using the result of the determination as the current state of the business, predict a final stage of the business entity, and a probability of evolving to that final stage from the current state. Other embodiments may be disclosed or claimed.",
