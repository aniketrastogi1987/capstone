The system can perform a multi-step iterative procedure including variable selection, feature set selection, training data selection, model development, model validation and process optimization. The system also performs local and global optimizations iteratively to determine the best possible model for a given scenario.",

The techniques include a multi-step iterative approach from variable selection, feature set selection, training data selection, model development, model validation and process optimization. Local and global optimizations may be performed iteratively to determine the best possible model for a given scenario.",
