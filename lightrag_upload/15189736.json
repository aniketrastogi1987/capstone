  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In view of the technical problem, the inventors have considered a non-abstract improvement to a computer technology via a technical solution to the technical problem in which a system can mine textual alert outputs from a secure trusted source for geolocation indicators (e.g., street intersections, mile marker, exit number on interstate, etc.) about an event (e.g., an accident, construction, road closing, etc.) and embed the alert outputs from the secure trusted source with the geolocation and a temporal tag such that the event can be mapped in a navigational service. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention can provide a geolocation data discovery system, including a secure text mining circuit configured to mine a textual alert message of an event from secure source data for a geolocational indicator, a temporal indicator, and a type of alert, a geolocation and temporal embedding circuit configured to embed a geolocational tag location and a temporal tag time to the event based on the geolocational indicator and the temporal indicator mined from the textual alert message by the secure text mining circuit, and an event mapping circuit configured to map the event with an icon related to the type of alert at the geolocational tag location on a navigational map at a time associated with the temporal tag time of the event. Further, in another exemplary embodiment, the present invention can provide a geolocation data discovery method, including mining a textual alert message of an event from secure source data for a geolocational indicator, a temporal indicator, and a type of alert, embedding a geolocational tag location and a temporal tag time to the event based on the geolocational indicator and the temporal indicator mined from the textual alert message by the mining, and mapping the event with an icon related to the type of alert at the geolocational tag location on a navigational map at a time associated with the temporal tag time of the ...",
