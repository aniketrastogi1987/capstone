  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Digital content interaction prediction and training techniques that address imbalanced classes are described. In one or more implementations, a digital medium environment is described to predict user interaction with digital content that addresses an imbalance of numbers included in first and second classes in training data used to train a model using machine learning, e.g., a first class of users that have interacted with digital content as opposed to a second class of users that have not. The training data is received that describes the first class and the second class, such as to describe users and corresponding characteristics of the users. A model is trained using machine learning. The training includes sampling the training data to include at least one subset of the training data from the first class and at least one subset of the training data from the second class. In this way, the sample is ensured to include training data from both classes, e.g., from users that have interacted with digital content as well as from users that have not. Iterative selections are made of a batch from the sampled training data. The iteratively selected batches are iteratively processed by a classifier implemented using machine learning to train the model. A likelihood of interaction with the digital content by the user is predicted using the trained model, the predicated likelihood used to control user interaction with the digital content. This Summary introduces a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. As such, this Summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.",
