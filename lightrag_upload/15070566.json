  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present application discloses embodiments that relate to systems, methods, and apparatuses that manage an image forming apparatus using test page data. By printing a test page, evaluating the resulting test page, and comparing it with test print image data established by a managing server, an image forming apparatus' current status can be evaluated. In one aspect, the present application describes an image forming apparatus management system. The system includes an image forming apparatus configured to print a test page. Additionally, the system includes a client computing device configured to transmit a test print data request to a managing server. The client computing device is also configured to transmit a test page print request to the image forming apparatus. The client computing device is further configured to scan the test page. The client computing device is additionally configured to transmit data scanned from the test page to the managing server. Furthermore, the managing server is configured to transmit test print data to the client computing device. The managing server is also configured to verify the data scanned from the test page against the test print data. In a different aspect, the present application describes a method for managing an image forming apparatus. The method includes transmitting, by a client computing device, a test print data request to a managing server. The method also includes transmitting, by the managing server, test print data to the client computing device. In addition, the method includes transmitting, by the client computing device, a test page print request to the image forming apparatus. The method further includes printing, by the image forming apparatus, a test page. Furthermore, the method includes scanning, by the client computing device, the test page. Additionally, the method includes transmitting, by the client computing device, data scanned from the test page to the managing server. Still fur...",

  "abstract": "The present disclosure is directed to a system, a method, and an apparatus that manage an image forming apparatus using test page data. In example embodiments, when a client computing device requires verification of the functionality of an image forming apparatus, the client computing device can initiate a request with a managing server. Through the transmission of a test page print request to the image forming apparatus, a scanning of a test page that is printed by the image forming apparatus, a transmission of data from the printed test page to the managing server, and the managing server verifying the data transmitted by the client computing device, the client computing device and managing server can verify the image forming apparatus.",
