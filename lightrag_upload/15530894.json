  "abstract": "This invention, which focuses on personality and aptitude matching by psychophysiologic response to stimuli, is referred to as Brain Matching. In general terms, this invention starts by selecting highly specialized skill sets and top performer group for each skill set. The various groups are analyzed though psychophysiologic stimuli testing by using basically the same testing consisting of large numbers stimuli tests in a consistent testing environment. Stimuli tests can range from hundreds to thousands of images each producing a brainwave response. Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning computers look at the test results, highly specialized group by other highly specialized group to reduce the groups signature/response commonality into a template. Test subjects are then tested using the same stimuli. The subject's test results are analyzed for correlation with the various specialized expert groups.",
