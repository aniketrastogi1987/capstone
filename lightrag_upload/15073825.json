  "abstract": "A vehicle scheduling device includes a processor configured to perform at least one objective function. An input interface communicatively is coupled to the processor and configured to accept input of a scheduling data, and the scheduling data includes at least one door environment parameter, an operational parameter, and dynamic information. A computer readable medium coupled to the processor and configured to receive the scheduling data, the computer readable medium further includes instructions stored therein, upon when executed by the processor, causes the processor to perform operations to generate an optimal scheduling plan. A display device is coupled to the processor and configured to output a visual representation of the optimal scheduling plan.",
