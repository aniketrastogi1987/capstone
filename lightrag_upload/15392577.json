  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor should it be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to extracting a summary for the status of a datacenter. More particularly, the status is automatically summarized into a description explaining what set of properties are more significant for the status such that high-level descriptions and summaries are provided. Given a snapshot of the datacenter infrastructure, that corresponds to the list of the different metrics and statistics gathered from the system, at a certain timestamp, past or historical information is used to determine what regions or parts of the system should be considered to better understand the behavior of system as a whole. Accordingly, a high-level summary of this behavior is provided.",

  "abstract": "In a datacenter setting, annotations or descriptions of relevant parts or subgraphs corresponding to components in the datacenter are predicted. Given a set of training data (library of subgraphs seen in the past labeled with a textual description explaining why were they considered relevant enough to be placed in the historical database), the recurrent neural network (RNN) learns how to combine the different textual annotations coming from each relevant region into a single annotation that describes the whole system. Accordingly, given a set of input or test data (datacenter state modeled a context graph that is not annotated), the system determines which regions of the input graph are more relevant, and for each of these regions, the RNN predicts an annotation even in a previously unseen or different datacenter infrastructure.",
