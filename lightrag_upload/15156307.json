  "abstract": "The subject disclosure is directed towards the use of Monte Carlo (MC) procedures for computing the value of information (VOI), including with long evidential sequences. An MC-VOI algorithm is used to output a decision as to balancing the value and costs of collecting information in advance of taking action by running prediction model-based simulations to determine execution paths through possible states, and processing the results of the simulations/paths taken into a final decision.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of representative concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used in any way that would limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Briefly, various aspects of the subject matter described herein are directed towards running simulations (Monte Carlo, or MC simulations) for computing the value of information (VOI), including with long evidential sequences. An MC-VOI algorithm performs (typically large) lookaheads using a sampling technique that can explore multiple observation and action outcome sequences with a single sample. Predictive models are used in the simulations. Other advantages may become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings.",
