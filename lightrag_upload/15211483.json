  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE <EOH>In an exemplary embodiment, a close-out audit method performed at a cell site subsequent to maintenance or installation work includes, subsequent to the maintenance or installation work, obtaining video capture of cell site components associated with the work; subsequent to the video capture, processing the video capture to obtain data for the close-out audit, wherein the processing comprises identifying the cell site components associated with the work; and creating a close-out audit package based on the processed video capture, wherein the close-out audit package provides verification of the maintenance or installation work and outlines that the maintenance or installation work was performed in a manner consistent with an operator or owner's guidelines. In another exemplary embodiment, a system adapted for a close-out audit of a cell site subsequent to maintenance or installation work includes a network interface and a processor communicatively coupled to one another; and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to, subsequent to the maintenance or installation work, obtain video capture of cell site components associated with the work; subsequent to the video capture, process the video capture to obtain data for the close-out audit, wherein the processing comprises identifying the cell site components associated with the work; and create a close-out audit package based on the processed video capture, wherein the close-out audit package provides verification of the maintenance or installation work and outlines that the maintenance or installation work was performed in a manner consistent with an operator or owner's guidelines. In a further exemplary embodiment, a non-transitory computer readable medium includes instructions that, when executed, cause one or more processors to perform the steps of, subsequent to the maintenance or installation work, obtaining video capture of cell site component...",
