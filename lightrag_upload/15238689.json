  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Accordingly, the inventor has conceived and reduced to practice, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, a system for measuring and assigning sentiment to an electronically transmitted message, comprising: a sentiment analysis measurement module comprising at least a plurality of programming instructions stored in a memory and operating on a processor of a network-connected computing device and configured to utilize a message collector component as an interface between an incoming messaging service and a recipient device through which an 0065lectronic message will be received; evaluate the incoming electronic message against a prescribed data set contained within a sentiment analysis database; communicate with a sentiment analysis tool which executes an extensive set of algorithms to parse, classify and analyze the message such that indicia of sentiment may be assigned; task a message rating component to assign the indicia of sentiment to the message; and utilize a sentiment indicator management tool to apply a plurality of rules to sort, assign priority, or toggle options for a preferred mode of identification for the indicia of sentiment. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, a system for measuring and assigning sentiment to an electronically transmitted message, comprising: a sentiment analysis measurement module comprising at least a plurality of programming instructions stored in a memory and operating on a processor of a network-connected computing device and further comprising a messaging relay component, configured to assign indicia of sentiment which may be identified and presented at the time of delivery of the electronic message or embedded within the electronic message, is disclosed. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, a method for measuring and assigning sentiment to an electronically transmitted message by using a sentiment analysis measurement module, the method comp...",
