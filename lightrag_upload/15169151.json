  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>It is desirable to provide a new, improved information processing apparatus, information processing method, and program capable of recognizing a user behavior with better accuracy. According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus including: a sensor data generator that senses a user behavior and generates sensor data corresponding to the user behavior; a behavior recognizing unit that recognizes the behavior exhibited by the user by performing a predetermined threshold value process on the sensor data and generates behavior information that is information indicating the behavior exhibited by the user; a behavior manager that manages the behavior information generated by the behavior recognizing unit in correspondence with the time point at which the behavior corresponding to the behavior information is exhibited; and a behavior information post-processing unit that performs a predetermined post-process on the behavior information managed by the behavior manager, in which the behavior recognizing unit further includes a plurality of behavior determination units specified to specific behaviors exhibited by the user and generates the behavior information based on the determination results of the plurality of behavior determination units. In the information processing apparatus, the behavior recognizing unit may at least include: a stopped state determination unit that determines whether or not the user is in the stopped state; a walking/running state determination unit that determines whether or not the user is in the walking state or in the running state; a jumping state determination unit that determines whether or not the user is in the jumping state; a posture change determination unit that determines whether or not the user is in the sitting state or in the standing state; an elevator boarding determination unit that determines whether or not the user is in the boarding-e...",
