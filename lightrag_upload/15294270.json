  "abstract": "Technologies are described herein for injecting elements into artificial intelligence content. According to some examples, content generated from an artificial intelligence source is received, facts are determined from the content, and terms are selected for use based on the facts. The terms are used to modify or are added to the content to generate modified artificial intelligence content.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Technologies are described herein for injecting elements into artificial intelligence content. Generally described, a system receives content from an artificial intelligence source. Content can be information such as text from web pages, video, documents, speech or aural input, and the like. In some examples, input from non-text artificial intelligence sources can be translated to text using various speech-to-text translator technologies. The system determines one or more data stores relevant to at least one fact identified in the content. The system accesses the relevant data store to determine data associated with the identified fact. Content associated with the determined data is injected into the artificial intelligence content. As used herein, “artificial intelligence” content is content constructed, written, or otherwise created by an artificial intelligence source. “Artificial intelligence” is broadly defined to be a computing source configured to operate fully or partially autonomously to generate content. It should be appreciated that the above-described subject matter can be implemented as a computer-controlled apparatus, a computer process, a computing system, or as an article of manufacture such as a computer-readable storage medium. These and various other features will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings. This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of technologies in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended that this Summary be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.",
