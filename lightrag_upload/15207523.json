  "abstract": "Methods, computing systems and computer program products implement embodiments of the present invention that include identifying a set of the items in the transactions, and executing, using input including the transactions, an implicit feedback collaborative filtering model to compute, for each of the users, a predicted rating for each of the items. Using input including the transactions and the predicted ratings as labels, a sentiment analysis model is executed to compute, for each given user, an opinion for each of the given items in the transactions for the given user, and using input including the transactions and the opinions as factors for the predicted ratings, an explicit feedback collaborative analysis model is executed to update, for each of the users, the predicted ratings for each of the items.",
