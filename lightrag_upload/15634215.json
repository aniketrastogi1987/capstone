  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Various aspects may include methods, computing devices with processors implementing methods, and non-transitory processor-readable storage media including instructions configured to cause a processor to execute operations of the methods for performance provisioning of applications executing on a computing device. Various aspects may include a processor of a computing device generating a work group, classifying a new work item for a software application into the generated work group using a work classification model, selecting a set of provisioning rules for the work item based, at least in part, on the work group to which the work item was classified, and executing the work item according to the selected set of provisioning rules. In some aspects, generating the work group may include the computing device identifying that a first set of collected computing device metric data belongs to a work group, collecting a second set of computing device metric data, analyzing the first set of collected computing device metric data and the second set of collected computing device metric data to obtain a measured quantity, determining whether the first set of collected computing device metric data and the second set of collected computing device metric data belong to the same work group based on the measured quantity, determining whether the first set of collected computing device metric data and the second set of collected computing device metric data represent the software application work groups in response to determining that the first set of collected computing device metric data and the second set of collected computing device metric data belong to the same work group, and ending a current data collection session in response to determining that the first set of collected computing device metric data and the second set of collected computing device metric data represent the software application work groups. In such aspects, the computing device metrics ma...",
