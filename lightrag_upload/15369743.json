  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of certain embodiments of the present disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and it does not identify key/critical elements of the present disclosure or delineate the scope of the present disclosure. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. In general, certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide techniques or mechanisms for improved object detection by a neural network. According to various embodiments, a method for gesture recognition using a neural network is provided. The method comprises a training mode and an inference mode. In the training mode, the method includes passing a dataset into the neural network, and training the neural network to recognize a gesture of interest. The dataset may comprise a random subset of a video with known gestures of interest. During the training mode, parameters in the neural network may be updated using a stochastic gradient descent. In the inference mode, the method includes passing a series of images into the neural network, and recognizing the gesture of interest in the series of images. The series of images may not be part of the dataset. The neural network may include a convolution-nonlinearity step and a recurrent step. The convolution-nonlinearity step comprises a convolution layer and a rectified linear layer. The convolution-nonlinearity step may comprise a plurality of convolution-nonlinearity layer pairs, each convolution-nonlinearity layer pair comprising a convolution layer followed by a rectified linear layer. The convolution-nonlinearity step takes a third-order tensor as input and outputs a feature tensor. The recurrent step comprises a concatenation layer followed by a convolution layer. The concatenation layer make take two third-order ...",
