  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Applicants recognized the problems noted above herein and conceived and developed embodiments of systems and methods, according to the present disclosure, for selecting, training, and compressing machine learning models. In an embodiment a non-transitory computer-readable medium with computer-executable instructions stored thereon executed by one or more processors to perform a method to select and implement a neural network for an embedded system. The method includes selecting a neural network from a library of neural networks based on one or more parameters of the embedded system, the one or more parameters constraining the selection of the neural network. In certain embodiments, the library may refer to a theoretical set of neural networks, an explicit library with a database, or a combination thereof. The method also includes training the neural network using a dataset. The method further includes compressing the neural network for implementation on the embedded system, wherein compressing the neural network comprises adjusting at least one float of the neural network. In another embodiment a method for selecting, training, and compressing a neural network includes evaluating a neural network from a library of neural networks, each neural network of the library of neural networks having an accuracy and size component. In certain embodiments, the library may refer to a theoretical set of neural networks, an explicit library with a database, or a combination thereof. The method also includes selecting the neural network from the library of neural networks based on one or more parameters of an embedded system intended to use the neural network, the one or more parameters constraining the selection of the neural network. The method further includes training the selected neural network using a dataset. The method includes compressing the selected neural network for implementation on the embedded system via bit quantization. In an embodiment a syste...",
