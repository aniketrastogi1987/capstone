  "abstract": "In an embodiment, a processor includes a compression domain threshold filter coupled to a plurality of cores. The compression domain threshold filter is to: receive a sample vector of compressed data to be filtered; calculate, based at least on a first subset of the elements of the sample vector, an estimated upper bound value of a dot product of the sample vector and a steering vector; determine whether the estimated upper bound value of the dot product satisfies a filter threshold value; and in response to a determination that the estimated upper bound value of the dot product does not satisfy the filter threshold value, discard the sample vector without completion of a calculation of the dot product of the sample vector and the steering vector. Other embodiments are described and claimed.",
