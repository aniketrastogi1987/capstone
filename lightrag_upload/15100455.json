  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a platform device, by means of which items of information stored in a first memory are utilizable by the network participants according to strictly predefinable processing criteria and are capable of being supplemented or amended in some other manner and by means of which an effective automated distribution of, in particular, collective knowledge representing an item of qualitative information is enabled. For a platform device of the type mentioned above this object is achieved in that the storage spaces are in each case formed on the platform by a dual unit DuU, wherein a dual unit DuU in each case comprises a first storage space that is assigned to a predefinable topic and provided with initial items of information formulated by an initial participant and is not editable by any other user or participant and also a second storage space assigned to the first storage space that is editable by any individual user or participant and is construed for insertion of additional information concerning the initial item of information stored in the first storage space by the plurality of users or participants, and wherein on recognition of the predefined topic by a search engine located at a web site, by means of a search item designated as electronic filter that corresponds to the predefined topic of the associated dual unit, a copying device copies the contents of the first storage space of the dual unit and the contents of the second storage space of the dual unit and transfers said contents as a bundle of information to the search engine located at a web site. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject matter of the subclaims. In the case of the platform device of the invention, on account of the combination of features to the effect that the storage spaces are in each case formed on the platform by a dual unit DuU, a dual unit DuU comprising in each case a first storage space assigned to a...",
