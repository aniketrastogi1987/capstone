  "abstract": "An information processing device for processing trade data for asset management and trading is disclosed. The information processing device includes the one or more processors configured to determine price of a commodity indicated by the trade data. The price being valid in an event the one or more processors receive a user input indicating authorization of a user to revoke a deal of the commodity within predetermined time duration. The one or more processors are configured to determine the price by using a neural network, the neural network being trained by the one or more processors based on one or more data sets corresponding to the commodity.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The present invention has been made in the view of the above problems, and in one aspect of the present invention there is provided an information processing device for processing trade data for asset management and trading. The information processing device includes the one or more processors configured to determine price of a commodity indicated by the trade data. The price being valid in an event the one or more processors receive a user input indicating authorization of a user to revoke a deal of the commodity within predetermined time duration. The one or more processors are configured to determine the price by using a neural network, the neural network being trained by the one or more processors based on one or more data sets corresponding to the commodity. In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for processing trade data for asset management and trading. The method, in an information processing device, includes determining price of a commodity indicated by the trade data. The price being valid in an event the information processing device receives a user input indicating authorization of a user to revoke a deal of the commodity within predetermined time duration. The price is determined by using a neural network, the neural network being trained by the information processing device based on one or more data sets corresponding to the commodity. In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a storage media storing a program executed by the computer, wherein the program includes a determining step to determine price of a commodity indicated by the trade data. The price being valid in an event the information processing device receives a user input indicating authorization of a user to revoke a deal of the commodity within predetermined time duration. The price is determined by using a neural network, the neural network being trained by the information processing device based on on...",
