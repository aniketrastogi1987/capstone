  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the invention relate to a neural network system for simulating neurons of a neural model. One embodiment comprises a memory device that maintains neuronal states for multiple neurons, a lookup table that maintains state transition information for multiple neuronal states, and a controller unit that manages the memory device. The controller unit updates a neuronal state for each neuron based on incoming spike events targeting said neuron and state transition information corresponding to said neuronal state. Another embodiment comprises an apparatus including a memory device and a controller unit. The memory device includes a lookup table that maintains information about multiple system states of a model system, wherein the lookup table is configured to provide information relating to a change in a system state when addressed by a current system state of the model system. The controller unit is configured to update system states for multiple instances of the model system based on the information maintained in lookup table and incoming data received by the controller unit. Another embodiment comprises maintaining neuronal states for multiple neurons, and maintaining state transition information for multiple neuronal states in a lookup table. A neuronal state for each neuron is updated based on incoming spike events targeting said neuron and state transition information corresponding to said neuronal state. Another embodiment comprises maintaining system states for multiple instances of a model system, and maintaining system state change information for the system states in a lookup table. The system state change information comprises information relating to changes in said system states. For each instance of the model system, the system state for said instance is updated based on incoming data and the system state change information maintained. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become...",
