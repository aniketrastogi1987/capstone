  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to an aspect of an embodiment, a machine learning result editing program recorded on a recording medium causes a computer to execute a process of generating a group of relevant words on the basis of expressions of words learned by a machine learning processing program that learns the expressions of the words on the basis of input data. The machine learning result editing program causes the computer to execute: a process of causing a display unit to display the generated group of relevant words; and a process of exercising control so that, after a designation of a word to fee eliminated from the displayed group of relevant words is received, when a process is performed by using the group of relevant words generated on the basis of the expressions of the words learned by the machine learning processing program, the process is performed by using the group from which the designated word has been eliminated. The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.",
