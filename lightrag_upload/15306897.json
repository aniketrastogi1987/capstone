  "abstract": "The inventive concepts herein relate to performing block retrieval on a block to be processed of a urine sediment image. The method comprises: using a plurality of decision trees to perform block retrieval on the block to be processed, wherein each of the plurality of decision trees comprises a judgment node and a leaf node, and the judgment node judges the block to be processed to make it reach the leaf node by using a block retrieval feature in a block retrieval feature set to form a block retrieval result at the leaf node, and at least two decision trees in the plurality of decision trees are different in structures thereof and/or judgments performed by the judgment nodes thereof by using the block retrieval feature; and integrating the block retrieval results of the plurality of decision trees so as to form a final block retrieval result.",
