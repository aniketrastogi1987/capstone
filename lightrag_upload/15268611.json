  "abstract": "A system and method for automatically optimizing states of communications and operations in a contact center, using a reinforcement learning module comprising a reinforcement learning server and an optimization server introduced to existing infrastructure of the contact center, that, through use of a model set up as a partially observable Markov chain with a Baum-Welch algorithm used to infer parameters and rewards added to form a partially observable Markov decision process, is solved to provide an optimal action policy to use in each state of a contact center, thereby ultimately optimizing states of communications and operations for an overall return.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Accordingly, the inventor has conceived and reduced to practice, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, a system for optimizing states of communications and operations in a contact center, using a reinforcement learning module comprising: a reinforcement learning server comprising at least a plurality of programming instructions stored in a memory and operating on a processor of a network-connected computing device and configured to observe and analyze historical and current data using a retrain and design server; develop a training set for use in a partially observable Markov chain model; assign desired rewards to specific states for use in a partially observable Markov decision process model; design and train the partially observable Markov decision process model using a retrain and design server to achieve a desired outcome; form the partially observable Markov decision process model by fitting the partially observable Markov chain model with a Baum-Welch algorithm to infer parameters based on observations; engage with an optimization server to apply and manage the partially observable Markov decision process model; record results of optimal actions carried out by the optimization server to a learning database; observe and analyze results of the optimal actions stored in the learning database; and repeat these steps iteratively; and an optimization server comprising at least a plurality of programming instructions stored in a memory and operating on a processor of a network-connected computing device and configured to apply optimal actions to states as assigned by the reinforcement learning server; manage and maintain a current revision of the partially observable Markov decision process model; assign an optimal action to each state to be executed by an action handler through interfaces with the contact center; initiate actions within the contact center through interfaces with an action handler; analyze events resulting fr...",
