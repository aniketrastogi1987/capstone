  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments can provide a computer implemented method in a data processing system comprising a processor and a memory, the memory comprising instructions that are executed by the processor to cause the processor to implement a system for providing profile photo enhancement, the method comprising receiving, from a specification source, one or more specifications for image acceptance criteria; receiving, from an uploading user, an image; examining, through an image processing toolbox, the image to determine if all of the image acceptance criteria are met; if all image acceptance criteria are met, accepting the image; and if one or more image acceptance criteria are not met, processing the image. Embodiments can further provide a method further comprising receiving, from a specification source, one or more specifications for image acceptance criteria, wherein the image acceptance criteria include a pre-determined number of focus items; determining, through the image processing toolbox, the number of focus items present on the image; if the image fails to have exactly the pre-determined number of focus items, highlighting, on a display, the focus items; allowing the uploading user to select one or more correct focus items; cropping the image to only display the correct focus items; and re-examining the image to determine if all of the image acceptance criteria are met. Embodiments can further provide a method further comprising receiving, from a specification source, one or more specifications for image acceptance criteria, wherein the image acceptance criteria include a pre-determined number of focus items; determining, through the image processing toolbox, the number of focus items present on the image; if the image fails to have exactly the pre-determined number of focus items, automatically cropping, by the image processing toolbox, the image to only display one or more correct focus items determined based on prior-known identity characteristics o...",
