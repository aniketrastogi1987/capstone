  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>A system and computer-usable medium are disclosed for using cognitive graph vectors to refine cognitive insights. More specifically, in one embodiment, the invention relates to a method for refining cognitive insights using cognitive graph vectors comprising: storing data from a plurality of data sources within a cognitive graph via a cognitive inference and learning system; associating a first set of the data within the cognitive graph with a first cognitive graph vector of a plurality of cognitive graph vectors via the cognitive inference and learning system; associating a second set of the data within the cognitive graph with a second cognitive graph vector of the plurality of cognitive graph vectors via the cognitive inference and learning system; processing the data from the plurality of data sources to provide cognitive insights via the cognitive inference and learning system; and refining the cognitive insights based upon a limitation relating to one of the plurality of cognitive graph vectors via the cognitive inference and learning system. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a system comprising: a processor; a data bus coupled to the processor; and a computer-usable medium embodying computer program code, the computer-usable medium being coupled to the data bus, the computer program code used for refining cognitive insights using cognitive graph vectors and comprising instructions executable by the processor and configured for: storing data from a plurality of data sources within a cognitive graph via a cognitive inference and learning system; associating a first set of the data within the cognitive graph with a first cognitive graph vector of a plurality of cognitive graph vectors via the cognitive inference and learning system; associating a second set of the data within the cognitive graph with a second cognitive graph vector of the plurality of cognitive graph vectors via the cognitive inference and learni...",
