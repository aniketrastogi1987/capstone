  "abstract": "A blade for a turbomachine bladed wheel, the blade comprising a root, an airfoil, and a tip. The root and the tip have respective platforms, each presenting a surface (15) on a side toward the airfoil, which surfaces are referred to respectively as the root platform wall and the tip platform wall. Each of these platform walls is constituted by a pressure side portion and a suction side portion situated respectively pressure side and on the suction side and meeting at a crest curve (45, 65). Fabrication of the blade is facilitated in particular by the fact that every point of a first surface selected from the pressure side and the suction side and every point of the root and tip platform wall portions situated on the same side as the first surface presents a normal forming an acute angle or a right angle relative to a direction referred to as the first fabrication direction. A method of modeling the blade.",
