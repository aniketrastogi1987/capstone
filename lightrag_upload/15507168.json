  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>According to an aspect of the invention, a method for providing health indication of a mechanical system, includes receiving, with a processor, signals indicative of vibration data of the mechanical system; pre-training, with the processor, features in the signals with a model; determining, with the processor, information related to vibration signatures in the signals; associating, with the processor, the vibration signatures with historical vibration data of the mechanical system; and building, with the processor, a multi- layer Deep Neural Network (DNN) from the vibration signatures and the historical vibration data. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative, further embodiments could include associating the vibration signatures with known fault types from the historical data. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative, further embodiments could include building an initial two-layer Deep Belief Net (DBN) from the signals. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative, further embodiments could include building a DBN from a stack of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) comprising hidden variables and observed variables. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative, further embodiments could include determining a non-linearity in the hidden variables using stepped sigmoid units, sigmoid units, or rectified linear units. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative, further embodiments could include building an additional two-layer DBN from the initial two-layer DBN. In addition to one or more of the features described above, or as an alternative, further embodiments could include associating the vibration signatures with ground truth labels representing known fault types from the historical vibration data. In addition to one or more of the features described abo...",
