  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention can provide a meeting management system, including a target determination circuit configured to determine a target of an agenda for a meeting, the target of the agenda including which users correspond to a topic, a behavior capturing circuit configured to capture behavior of the users during the meeting, a tracking and identifying circuit configured to track the behavior of the users during the meeting and identifying a user of the users corresponding to the behavior, and a difference determination circuit configured to determine if a difference between the behavior of the users and the target of the agenda is greater than a threshold value. Further, in another exemplary embodiment, the present invention can provide a non-transitory computer-readable recording medium recording a meeting management program, the program causing a computer to perform: determining a target of an agenda for a meeting, the target of the agenda including which users correspond to a topic, capturing behavior of the users during the meeting, tracking and identifying the behavior of the users during the meeting and identifying a user of the users corresponding to the behavior, and determining if a difference between the behavior of the users and the target of the agenda is greater than a threshold value. Even further, in another exemplary embodiment, the present invention can provide a meeting management method, including determining a target of an agenda for a meeting, the target of the agenda including which users correspond to a topic, capturing behavior of the users during the meeting, tracking and identifying the behavior of the users during the meeting and identifying a user of the users corresponding to the behavior, and determining if a difference between the behavior of the users and the target of the agenda is greater than a threshold value. There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, an embodiment of the inventi...",
