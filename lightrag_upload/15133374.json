  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to aspects of the present invention, there is a method, computer program product, and/or system for identifying and initiating actions of a meeting. The method includes one or more computer processors monitoring a meeting, where monitoring the meeting includes receiving input from at least a first computing device. The method further includes identifying a plurality of metadata triggers associated with the received input of the meeting. The method further includes identifying an occurrence of a first metadata trigger of the plurality of metadata triggers associated with the received input of the meeting. The method further includes analyzing a first portion of the received input of the meeting that includes an occurrence of the first metadata trigger, where analyzing the first portion of the received input includes identifying a first action. The method further includes determining a response criterion of the first metadata trigger. The method further includes responding to a determination that the first metadata trigger includes a response criterion indicating immediate action by initiating the first action.",
