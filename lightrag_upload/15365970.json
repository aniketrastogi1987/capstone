  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>The invention is defined by the features of the independent claims. Some specific embodiments are defined in the dependent claims. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus comprising at least one processing core, at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code being configured to, with the at least one processing core, cause the apparatus at least to determine a predicted user activity type based at least partly on a thematic map database and a current location of the apparatus, present the predicted user activity type as a suggested activity type to a first user, and responsive to the first user approving the suggested activity type, initiate an activity session of the suggested activity type. Various embodiments of the first aspect may comprise at least one feature from the following bulleted list: the thematic map database comprises a heat map the thematic map database associates past indications of activity type with geographic locations where the past indications of activity type have been made the past indications of activity type have been made by a plurality of users the at least one memory and the computer program code are configured to, with the at least one processing core, cause the apparatus to determine the predicted user activity type based at least partly on at least one of the following: a season of the year, a time of day, an output of an acceleration sensor, user settings of the first user and history information of the first user the acceleration sensor is comprised in the apparatus the apparatus is configured to receive the output of the acceleration sensor from a personal device of the user the apparatus is configured to receive the output of the acceleration sensor via a short-range wireless interface arranged between the apparatus and the personal device of the user the at least one memory and the computer...",
