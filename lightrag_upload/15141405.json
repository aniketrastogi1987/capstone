  "abstract": "Aspects of the technology described herein provide a personalized computing experience for a user based on a predicted future semantic location of the user. In particular, a likely future location (or sequences of future locations) for a user may be determined, including contextual information about the future location. Using information from the current context of the user's current location with historical observations about the user and expected user events, out-of-routine events, or other lasting or ephemeral information, a prediction of one or more future semantic locations and corresponding confidences may be determined and used for providing personalized computing services to the user. The prediction may be provided to an application or service such as a personal assistant service associated with the user, or may be provided as an API to facilitate consumption of the prediction information by an application or service.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used in isolation as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Embodiments described in this disclosure are directed towards systems and methods for providing a personalized computing experience for a user of the technologies described herein based on determining future semantic location information for the user. In particular, embodiments may determine a likely location (or likely sequence(s) of locations) that a user will visit in the future. Some embodiments may further predict related contextual or semantic information, such as when a user will likely arrive; how long a user will likely stay; likely activity of the user associated with the location (e.g., exercising at a gym or grocery shopping); or other contextual information. Using information about the user's current location with historical observations about the user, expected user events (e.g., an expected flight or an appointment), and/or other lasting information or ephemeral information (e.g., holidays and traffic, respectively), a prediction of one or more future semantic locations and corresponding confidences may be determined and may be used for providing a personalized computing experience to the user. Additionally, some embodiments of the disclosure are able to predict unique or relatively rare future events. The prediction information may be provided to an application or service such as a personal assistant (sometimes referred to as a virtual assistant) service associated with the user, or may be provided as an application programming interface (API) to facilitate consumption of the prediction information by an application or service. Further, in some cases, the predictions may be adj...",
