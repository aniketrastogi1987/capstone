To achieve above objectives, embodiments of the present application adopt the following technical solutions: In one aspect, embodiments of the present application provide a method for identifying whether an application is genuine by means of digital watermarks, which comprises: acquiring an executable file of an application to be identified, and extracting a first digital watermark from the executable file; using a decompiling-then-compiling algorithm on the executable file so as to generate a first compilation file having a same file format as that of the executable file, and extracting a second digital watermark from the first compilation file; wherein, the second digital watermark and the first digital watermark belong to the same type of digital watermarks; using another decompiling-then-compiling algorithm on the executable file so as to generate a second compilation file having a same file format as that of the executable file, and extracting a third digital watermark from the second compilation file; wherein, the third digital watermark and the first digital watermark belong to the same type of digital watermarks; and in the another decompiling-then-compiling algorithm, the format of the file generated after decompiling is identical with that of a corresponding file generated during compiling and generating the executable file of a genuine application corresponding to the application to be identified; acquiring similarity between the first digital watermark and the second digital watermark and similarity between the first digital watermark and the third digital watermark; comparing the similarity between the first digital watermark and the second digital watermark with the similarity between the...",
