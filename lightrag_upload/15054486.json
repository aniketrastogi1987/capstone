  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>According to a first aspect of the invention, an image processing device includes a memory configured to store a plurality of captured images; and a processor comprising hardware, wherein the processor is configured to implement: an image selection unit configured to: select a reference image from among the plurality of captured images stored in the memory; and select images to be combined with the reference image from: a first group of images among the plurality of captured images, the first group of images being captured earlier than the reference image; and a second group of images among the plurality of captured images, the second group of images being captured later than the reference image; and a composition processing unit configured to compose the images to be combined selected by the image selection unit with the reference image selected by the image selection unit to generate a composite image. According to a second aspect of the invention, an endoscope apparatus includes an insertion unit; an imaging unit disposed at a tip of the insertion unit; an image processing device, wherein the image processing device includes: a memory configured to store a plurality of captured images which are captured by the imaging portion, a processor comprising hardware, wherein the processor is configured to implement: an image selection unit configured to: select a reference image from among the plurality of captured images stored in the memory; and select images to be combined with the reference image from: a first group of images among the plurality of captured images, the first group of images being captured earlier than the reference image; and a second group of images among the plurality of captured images, the second group of images being captured later than the reference image; and a composition processing unit configured to compose the images to be combined selected by the image selection unit with the reference image selected by...",
