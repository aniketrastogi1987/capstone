  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one example, the disclosure is directed to a method that includes determining, by an assistant executing at one or more processors, content for a conversation with a user of a computing device, selecting, by the assistant, based on the content and information associated with the user, a modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user, and causing, by the assistant, in the modality, a signaling of the conversation with the user. In another example, the disclosure is directed to a system that includes one or more processors and a memory comprising instructions that when executed cause the one or more processors to determine content for a conversation with a user of a computing device, select, based on the content and information associated with the user, a modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user, and cause, in the modality, a signaling of the conversation with the user. In another example, the disclosure is directed to a computer-readable storage medium including instructions that when executed cause one or more processors of a system to determine content for a conversation with a user of a computing device, select, based on the content and information associated with the user, a modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user, and cause, in the modality, a signaling of the conversation with the user. In another example, the disclosure is directed to a system comprising means for determining, by an assistant executing at one or more processors, content for a conversation with a user of a computing device, means for selecting, by the assistant, based on the content and information associated with the user, a modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user, and means for causing, by the assistant, in the modality, a signaling of the conversation with the user. The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, ...",
