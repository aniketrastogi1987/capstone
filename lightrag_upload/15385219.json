  "abstract": "A neuromorphic computing apparatus has a network of neuromorphic cores, with each core including an input axon and a plurality of neurons having synapses. The input axon is associated with an input data store to store an input trace representing a time series of filtered pre-synaptic spike events, and accessible by the synapses of the plurality of neurons of the core. Each neuron includes at least one dendritic compartment to store and process variables representing a dynamic state of the neuron. Each compartment is associated with a compartment-specific data store to store an output trace representing a time series of filtered post-synaptic spike events. Each neuron includes a learning engine to apply a set of one or more learning rules based on the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic spike events to produce an adjustment of parameters of a corresponding synapse to those spike events.",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram of a model neural core structure. FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process carried out as part of the operations of the neural core structure of FIG. 1 according to an illustrative example. FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B illustrate aspects of the mapping operations of the synapse structures shown as part of the structure of FIG. 1 according to some examples. FIG. 4A is a diagram that illustrates an example configuration of a multi-compartment neuronal and a dendritic accumulation process for handling and scheduling spikes into the future according to an example. FIG. 4B is a pictorial diagram that shows a state structure of multiple compartments and illustrates how the sequential walk through the compartment indices can implement a tree-structured data flow according to an example. FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating state dynamics for a dendritic compartment according to an example. FIG. 6 is a simplified timing diagram illustrating an example of a trace variable that may be maintained at a neuron according to an example. FIG. 7 is a high-level block diagram illustrating a portion of a neural network core architecture according to some embodiments. FIG. 8 is a process flow diagram illustrating an example embodiment that augments the inference-only flow depicted in FIG. 2 with the added operations used for supporting learning in the core. FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating an example neural core structure in greater detail to expand upon the example neural core structure depicted in FIG. 1 . FIG. 10 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process of initiating and performing a learning cycle in a neural network according to some embodiments. FIG. 11 lists various examples of learning rules. detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?",
