  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In one aspect of the present invention, a computer-implemented biofeedback system includes a display device; a user interface; a database configured to store and selectively retrieve a plurality of visualization animation representative of human body parts functioning optimally and functioning subject to a plurality of predetermined conditions; a computer operatively connected to the display device, database and the user interface, wherein the computer is configured to prompt a user through the user interface to identify one or more predetermined conditions, wherein the computer is configured to associate each identified predetermined condition with at least one human body part, and wherein the computer is configured to selectively retrieve from the database at least two visualization animations representative of the at least one human body part functioning optimally and functioning subject to each identified predetermined conditions; and the database configured to display through the display device said at least two visualization animations associated with each identified predetermined conditions. In another aspect of the present invention, the computer-implemented biofeedback system the computer is further configured to transmit through the user interface or the display device a set of instructions advising the user how to engage said at least two visualization animations, wherein the set of instructions defines a sequential order for viewing said at least two visualization animations, wherein the set of instructions prompts the user to envision improvement of each identified predetermined condition when viewing said at least two visualization animations, wherein the set of instructions prompts the user to envision how the one or more associated human body parts would look if each identified predetermined condition were non-existent, further including at least one external biofeedback device operatively connected to the computer...",
