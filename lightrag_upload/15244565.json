  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A reviewing physician (a “reviewer”) generates a report as part of an image study (e.g., a cardiology report, ultrasound report, etc.). A reviewer may dictate the report and a natural language processing engine may attempt to understand the words and semantics of free speech to determine discrete data elements for the report. Although this approach is easy to use from the perspective of the reviewer, the resulting report is unstructured, which makes data mining and other analytics difficult. Also, certain clinical areas lexicons contain specific terms and an expected report structure that cannot be created efficiently through free speed recognition. Furthermore, some types of reports (e.g., cardiology) are too complex or too lengthy to be properly handled through a natural language processing engine. Alternatively, structured reporting software applications allow a reviewer to generate a structured report. For example, a structured reporting software application may provide a menu of available report data elements that a reviewer may select and then populate the applicable data elements (e.g., provide values for the selected data elements). The menu of available data elements is commonly structured as a tree structure, where a user may drill-down from a high-level report type to specific data elements. Using such a tree structure, however, requires a reviewer to select discrete data elements that are used to form written sentences included in a final report, which involves a large amount of user interaction with the software application (e.g., mouse clicks) that may interrupt the reviewer from viewing data (e.g., images) that he or she is reporting on. However, the resulting structured report includes discrete data elements that are clearly defined, which enables powerful analytics. Embodiments of the invention provide methods and systems for using contextual information within a reporting application, such as a medical software reporting applicat...",

  "abstract": "Methods and systems for using contextual information to generate reports for image studies. One method includes determining contextual information associated with an image study, at least one image included in the image study loaded within a reporting application and automatically selecting, with an electronic processor, at least one discrete data element for a structured report generated using the reporting application for the image study based on the contextual information. The method also includes receiving a value for the at least one discrete data element and adding the value for the at least one discrete data element to the structured report.",
