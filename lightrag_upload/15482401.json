  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>According to the data analysis system of the related art, data related to a predetermined case can be found out from a huge amount of data. However, there have been some problems with such data analysis system that even if the degree of relevance of data to a predetermined case is not originally high, the data may be evaluated as data highly relevant to the predetermined case, or the converse situation may occur. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a data analysis system and the like capable of accurately evaluating the relevance of analysis target data to a predetermined case. The above-mentioned object is attained by a data analysis system for analyzing data, wherein the data analysis system includes: a memory configured to at least temporarily store a plurality of pieces of evaluation data which is a target to be analyzed; and a controller configured to evaluate the plurality of pieces of evaluation data on the basis of learning data, wherein the controller is configured to: extract a plurality of components from the learning data, each of the plurality of components constituting at least part of the learning data; select a component to be utilized for evaluation of the plurality of pieces of evaluation data, from among the plurality of components, on the basis of evaluation information about each of the plurality of extracted components; and evaluate the evaluation data by utilizing the selected component. According to the above-mentioned disclosure, a data analysis system and the like capable of accurately evaluating the relevance of analysis target data to a predetermined case are provided.",
