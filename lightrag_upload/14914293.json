  "abstract": "It is an object of the present invention to provide a maintenance service method capable of reducing the number of machine parts to be replaced while suppressing the number of times of failures of an apparatus even when an accurate failure probability distribution cannot be estimated concerning single machine parts. Solving means of the present invention is characterized by setting, according to at least one of a failure probability distribution and a performance deterioration probability distribution set for each of machine part types, the number of machine parts to be replaced, setting machine part replacement priority from at least one of the probability distribution and an operation situation or a machine part state, and listing, according to the machine part replacement priority, machine parts equivalent to the number of machine parts to be replaced.",
