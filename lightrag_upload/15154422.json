  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer-implemented search application comprising a graphical user interface, an application programming interface communicably coupled to a search engine, and a database, said search engine being configured to perform an Internet search in response to a search query and display results of said search on a screen of a user's computing device, said application programming interface being configured to: provide a selectable function and display a control element representative thereof, via said graphical user interface on said screen of said user's computing device, said selectable function being configured such that, when selected by a user, a new folder is created; enable a user to select one or more search results displayed on said screen and cause it/them to be moved into said new folder; display, via said graphical user interface, data representative of said new folder including said one or more search results contained therein; and save said new folder including said one or more search results in said database; said application programming interface being further configured to cause said search engine to perform a search of said database, in response to a search query, and display on said screen data representative of relevant folders including search results created by other users and stored in said database together with said search results. The application programming interface may be configured to enable a user to apply a chosen name to said folder, said name being in the form of an alphanumeric string entered by said user. The application programming interface may be configured to enable a user to select one or more search results displayed on said screen in respect of a further Internet search, and cause it/them to be moved to a folder previously created by said user. The application programming interface may be configured to enable a user to edi...",
