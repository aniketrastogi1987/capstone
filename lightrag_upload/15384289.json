  "abstract": "A card reading device includes a card shoe part in which cards are housed, a card reading part that reads information on the cards drawn out, a control part that determines the outcome of a game based on the read information on the cards, and display parts that display the determined outcome of the game. In a tabletop game system, the information on the cards read by the card reading part and information on the game outcome determined by the control part are transmitted from the card reading device to a main computer apparatus via wireless communication. The card reading device includes a battery that supplies electric power to the control part, the display parts and a wireless output part. The card reading device, as such, is capable of facilitating moving the card reading device in a participatory tabletop game.",
