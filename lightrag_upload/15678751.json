  "abstract": "A computer-implemented method for automatically analyzing log contents received via a network and detecting content-level anomalies is presented. The computer-implemented method includes building a statistical model based on contents of a set of training logs and detecting, based on the set of training logs, content-level anomalies for a set of testing logs. The method further includes maintaining an index and metadata, generating attributes for fields, editing model capability to incorporate user domain knowledge, detecting anomalies using field attributes, and improving anomaly quality by using user feedback.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A computer-implemented method for automatically analyzing log contents received via a network and detecting content-level anomalies is presented. The method includes building a statistical model based on contents of a set of training logs and detecting, based on the set of training logs, content-level anomalies for a set of testing logs. A system for automatically analyzing log contents received via a network and detecting content-level anomalies is presented. The system includes a memory and a processor in communication with the memory, wherein the processor is configured to build a statistical model based on contents of a set of training logs and detect, based on the set of training logs, content-level anomalies for a set of testing logs. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium including a computer-readable program for automatically analyzing log contents received via a network and detecting content-level anomalies is presented, wherein the computer-readable program when executed on a computer causes the computer to perform the steps of building a statistical model based on contents of a set of training logs and detecting, based on the set of training logs, content-level anomalies for a set of testing logs. These and other features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.",
