  "abstract": "A learning apparatus includes: an update unit which updates a dictionary used by a classifier; a calculation unit which calculates, by using a dictionary updated and one or more samples with labeling being samples assigned with labels, a ratio to a number of the samples with labeling as a loss with respect to all the samples with labeling; and a determination unit which determines whether to update the dictionary, by using the loss, wherein, when the determination unit determines to update the dictionary, the update unit updates the dictionary by using the samples with labeling added with a new sample with labeling, and wherein the determination unit determines whether to update the dictionary, by using a loss calculated by using the updated dictionary and a loss calculated by using the dictionary before updating with respect to all the samples with labeling before adding the new sample with labeling.",
