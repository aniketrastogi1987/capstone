  "abstract": "Disclosed is a computing device. The computing device can include a processor and a memory. The memory can store instructions that, when executed by the processor, can cause the processor to perform operations. The operations can comprise determining a computational burden for a component of an application, developing a cost model, and generating resource provisioning set points. The component of the application can execute at a specified performance level. The cost model can specify a cost to execute the component of the application over a range of performance levels. The range of performance levels can include the specified performance level. Each of the resource provisioning set points can indicate a quantity of compute nodes assigned for each phase of the component of the application. The quantity of compute nodes can be based on the specified performance level and the cost to execute the component of the application.",
