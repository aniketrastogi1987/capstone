  "abstract": "An image quality enhancing apparatus, an image display apparatus, an image quality enhancing method, and a computer readable storage medium which make a learning-type image quality enhancing method utilizing a sparse expression practical are provided. The image quality enhancing apparatus calculates, from the feature quantity of an image, coefficients of low-image-quality base vectors expressing a feature quantity with a linear sum and generates the image with the enhanced image quality by calculating a linear sum of high-image-quality base vectors using the calculated coefficient. When calculating the coefficient, T base vectors highly influential on the feature quantity are selected from among a plurality of base vectors and an analytic solution making L2 norm of a coefficient matrix Î± as small as possible is calculated. A sparse solution of the coefficients can be obtained without using the iteration method and a practical image quality enhancing apparatus can be realized.",
