  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>According to an embodiment of the present invention there is provided a computer-implemented method for protecting state data of computer system code, comprising: creating or modifying an item of state data having a field value and being stored in memory for access by computer system code; registering an item of state data for protection; preserving the field value of the item of state data in a form inaccessible to third party software; validating the field value of the item of state data by comparing a current field value with the preserved field value to determine if the field value has been modified; and, if the field value has been modified, taking appropriate action. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for protecting state data of computer system code, comprising: a processor and a memory configured to provide computer program instructions to the processor to execute the functions of the components; a new data component for creating or modifying an item of state data having a field value and being stored in memory for access by computer system code; a registering component for registering an item of state data for protection; a data preservation component for preserving the field value of the item of state data in a form inaccessible to third party software; a validation component for validating the field value of the item of state data by comparing a current field value with the preserved field value to determine if the field value has been modified; and an action component for, if the field value has been modified, taking appropriate action. According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a computer program product for protecting state data of computer system code, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a processor to cause the processor to: generate (...",

  "abstract": "A method, system, and computer program product are provided for protecting state data of computer system code. The computer system code may be operating system code, subsystem code or application code and the item of state data is not expected to change within the execution of the computer system code. The method includes: creating or modifying an item of state data having a field value and being stored in memory for access by computer system code; registering an item of state data for protection; preserving the field value of the item of state data in a form inaccessible to third party software; validating the field value of the item of state data by comparing a current field value with the preserved field value to determine if the field value has been modified; and, if the field value has been modified, taking appropriate action.",
