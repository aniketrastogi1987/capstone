  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF INVENTION <EOH>In view of the foregoing and other problems, disadvantages, and drawbacks of the aforementioned background art, an exemplary aspect of the present invention provides smart sensing including a method, system, and apparatus for distributed and fault tolerant hierarchical autonomous cognitive instrumentation. One aspect of the present invention provides a modular node, includes a semiconductor chip, including modular sensors to detect events or changes in environment, modular actuators for moving or controlling an object, a non-transitory computer readable medium storing a program and a neuromorphic hardware configuration, a processor to control module networking and setup, and a neuromorphic hardware configured executing the program configured to receive information from the modular sensors and modular actuators, autonomously process the information received from the modular sensors and actuators, determine a validity of the information received from the modular sensors and actuators, and autonomously communicate with neighboring modular nodes for network auto-arrangement. Another aspect of the present invention provides a method of a modular node, the method including receiving information from a plurality of modular sensors and modular actuators, autonomously processing the information received from the modular sensors and actuators, determining a validity of the information received from the modular sensors and actuators, and autonomously communicating with neighboring modular nodes for network auto-arrangement. Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a computer program product for distributed and fault tolerant hierarchical autonomous cognitive instrumentation, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions readable and executable by a computer and neuromorphic hardware configuration loadable by the neuromorphic chip to ...",
