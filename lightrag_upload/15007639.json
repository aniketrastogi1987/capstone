  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of performing by one or more computers, receiving a message authored by a user, determining, using a first classifier, that the message can contain at least a first word describing positive or negative sentiment and, based thereon, extracting, using a first feature extractor, one or more features of the message, wherein each feature can comprise a respective word or phrase in the message and a respective weight signifying a degree of positive or negative sentiment, and determining, using a second classifier that can use the extracted features as input, a score describing a degree of positive or negative sentiment of the message, wherein the first feature extractor was trained with a set of training messages that each was labeled as having positive or negative sentiment. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs. These and other aspects can optionally include one or more of the following features. The second classifier was trained with features extracted by the first feature extractor from the set of training messages. The first word can be an emoticon, emoji, a word having a particular character in the word's correct spelling form that is repeated consecutively one or more times, an abbreviated or shortened word, or a text string with two or more consecutive symbols. The first feature extractor can be an artificial neural network feature extractor. The second classifier can be a naive Bayes classifier, random forest classifier, or support vector machines classifier. Extracting one or more features of the message can further comprise extracting, using a second feature extractor, one or more features of the message wherein each of the extracted features can comprise: (i) two or more consecutive words that describe positive or negative sentiment, (ii) a count of words, ...",
