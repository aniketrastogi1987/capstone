  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>A machine tool can machine a workpiece into a desired shape by cutting the workpiece while moving a tool relative to the workpiece. A method for manufacturing an impeller is known in which a machine tool cuts a single base material so as to manufacture an impeller. In this case, a base part and blade parts are produced by cutting a single member. The impeller that has an imbalance vibrates or suffers a breakdown during rotation. Especially, the impeller that is used for a supercharger of an internal combustion engine of a vehicle or the like rotates at high speed. The allowable value of imbalance in the impeller that rotates at high speed is several mg which is very small. Thus, machining accuracy is significantly affected by an assembly error in the machine tool or thermal displacement of the machine tool. The imbalance amount in a product may be reduced by measuring a mechanical error and the thermal displacement amount of the machine tool and adjusting a setting value that is included in a machining program. Unfortunately, it is difficult to configure the machining program, and the imbalance amount in a product may exceed the allowable value. A machine learning apparatus of the present invention learns a setting value in a machining program of a machine tool configured to machine an impeller. The machine learning apparatus includes a state observation unit configured to acquire a thermal displacement amount during a period of machining a workpiece, as a state variable. The machine learning apparatus includes a determination data acquisition unit configured to receive an imbalance amount in the impeller after machining as determination data. The machine learning apparatus includes a learning unit configured to learn the setting value in the machining program on the basis of output from the state observation unit and output from the determination data acquisition unit. In the above-described invention, the setting value in the ma...",
