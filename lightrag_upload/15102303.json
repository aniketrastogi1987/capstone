  "abstract": "An objective of the present invention is to efficiently identify a combination of other variables which contribute to variation of a target variable, and extract same as explanatory variables (factors). A factor extraction system according to the present invention defines a covariant composite variable which is configured of a combination of event variables and a binary number which represents whether the combination is present in event data, and obtains a correlation between the covariant composite variable and the target variable, thereby extracting contribution factors.",
