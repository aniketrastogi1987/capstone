  "abstract": "There is provided a scene rendering system and method for use by such a system to perform depth buffering for subsequent scene rendering. The system includes a memory storing a depth determination software including a reduced depth set identification software module, and a hardware processor configured to execute the depth determination software. The hardware processor is configured to execute the depth determination software to determine, before rendering a scene, a depth buffer based on at least one fixed depth identified for each element of a rendering framework for the scene. The hardware processor is further configured to render the scene using the depth buffer.",
