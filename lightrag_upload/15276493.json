  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE <EOH>In a first aspect of this disclosure, there is provided an apparatus for surfacing transmedia content to a given user of a plurality of users comprising: a memory configured to store: a plurality of transmedia content items, each content item being associated with at least one of the plurality of users; and linking data which define time-ordered content links between the plurality of transmedia content items, the plurality of transmedia content items being arranged into linked transmedia content subsets comprising different groups of the transmedia content items and different content links therebetween; a transmedia content linking engine configured to receive user input indicative of a time-ordering between at least two user-selected transmedia content items and generate the content link data for storage in the memory, thereby defining a linked transmedia content subset including the at least two user-selected transmedia content items; and a recommender engine configured to access the memory and surface to the given user: one or more content items of the plurality of transmedia content items; and/or one or more of the linked transmedia content subsets of the linked transmedia content subsets; and/or one or more identifications of identified users other than the given user; and/or the content items of the plurality of transmedia content items associated with at least one identified user other than the given user, wherein the one or more surfaced content items and/or the one or more surfaced linked transmedia content subsets are surfaced for selection by the given user via the transmedia content linking engine as one or more user-selectable transmedia content items. The apparatus thus provides for transmedia content, whether individual items, subset groups thereof, or owners associated thereto, to be readily identified and surfaced so that a given user can utilise such content within their apparatus, even if it is associated with ...",
