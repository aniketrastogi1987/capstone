  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An electronic device, such as a wearable device including a piece of clothing (e.g. a shirt, shoes, etc.), an accessory (e.g., a watch), etc., is capable of changing its appearance or physical characteristics (e.g., using e-textile technology, embedded technology), creating output (visible, audible, olfactory, etc.) that is entertaining or useful to the user. The wearable electronic device is responsive to control commands received from a controller. The control commands are based on a predicted situational context of the individual user. The predicted situational context is determined based on “inferred insights.” As used herein, “inferred insights” are characterizations extracted from a persistent inferred state representing the user that denote information regarding the user that is not expressly available. The persistent inferred state is based on information potentially including, without limitation, data describing the user, metadata about the user, the user's real-world activities and interactions, and communications made by the user in combination with data sensed by the wearable device, which is equipped with various sensors to detect data directly from the user or from the environment surrounding the user. The persistent inferred state representing the user is updated by a variety of context data inputs and/or mined data that are collected from sources of data relating to the individual user including without limitation from interactions between the user and the user's personal digital assistant, the user's habitual data, data mined from online sources regarding the user, online profile information regarding the user, data supplied by the user, etc. A situational context is predicted based on the updated persistent state, data regarding the user's environment, data sensed from the wearable electronic device, etc. This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Det...",
