  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>According to this disclosure, a method, apparatus and computer program product for performing database maintenance. A database running in a computer includes a first data file and a first log file. A snapshot copy of the first data file is created. Database maintenance is performed on the first snapshot copy of the first data file to produce a maintained snapshot copy of the first data file. A snapshot restore operation is performed on the database by replacing the first data file with the maintained snapshot copy of the first data file. The maintained snapshot copy of the first data file is updated according to logged transactions in the first log file which occurred after the snapshot copy of the first data file was created. In this way, a new data file is created which is both a product of the database maintenance as well as the database transactions which occurred while the database maintenance occurred. The foregoing has outlined some of the more pertinent features of the disclosed subject matter. These features should be construed to be merely illustrative. Many other beneficial results can be attained by applying the disclosed subject matter in a different manner or by modifying the invention as will be described.",
