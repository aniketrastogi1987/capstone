  "abstract": "Methods for classifying subjects and analyzing the relation between subject classification and multiple features of the subjects are provided. Some embodiments of the disclosure provide processes that use clustering analysis as an unsupervised machine learning technique to classify subjects based on multiple features. Some embodiments may associate features of the subjects with a categorical variable on which subject groups are based. This association between the features and the categorical variable of interest (or subject groups) can be obtained by finding featured-based clusters that have similar members as the subject groups. Systems and computer program products implementing the methods are also disclosed.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In one aspect, methods are provided for subject classification using unsupervised machine learning approaches. In some embodiments, the methods are implemented on a computer system that includes one or more processors and system memory. In some embodiments, a method includes the following operations: (a) providing, on the computer system, a dataset including a plurality of feature vectors for a plurality of subjects in a pair of subject groups, wherein each feature vector includes data for one or more features for one subject; (b) splitting, by the computer system, the plurality of subjects into a pair of clusters by performing a cluster analysis for each feature, thereby obtaining a plurality of cluster pairs; (c) scoring, by the computer system, each feature's ability to discriminate between the pair of subject groups; (d) selecting, by the computer system, two or more features that score higher than other features; and (e) combining, by the computer system, the selected features to form a pair-wise discriminator between the pair of subject groups. In some embodiments, the method also includes (f) repeating (a)-(e) for additional pairs of subject groups, thereby forming pair-wise discriminators for multiple pairs of subject groups. In some embodiments, the method further includes (g) classifying which subject group a test subject belongs to by applying the pair-wise discriminators of one or more pairs of subject groups. In some implementations, (g) involves determining which one of the two groups in a pair of subject groups is a nearest neighbor of the test subject for each pair of the subject groups, and classifying the subject as a member of the subject group that is most frequently determined to be the nearest neighbor across all pairs of subject groups under consideration. In some implementations, the method for subject classification further involves obtaining a p value of the classifying of (g), which p value indicates the probability of r...",
