The method also includes performing, by the processor, a maximally collapsing metric learning on the product vectors using learned synthetic exemplars and learned high-order filters. The learned high-order filters represent high-order embedding parameters. The method additionally includes performing, by the processor, an output operation to output a set of data that includes (i) interpretable factorized high-order filters, (ii) exemplars representative of the class labels and data separation properties in two-dimensional space, and (iii) a two-dimensional embedding of the high-dimensional data points. According to another aspect of the present invention, a computer program product is provided for scalable supervised high-order parametric embedding for big data visualization. The computer program product includes a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith. The program instructions are executable by a computer to cause the computer to perform a method. The method includes receiving, by a processor, feature vectors and class labels. Each of the feature vectors is representative of a respective one of a plurality of high-dimensional data points. The class labels denote classes for the high-dimensional data points. The method further includes multiplying, by the processor, each of the feature vectors ...",
