  "abstract": "Approaches useful to operation of scalable processors with ever larger numbers of logic devices (e.g., qubits) advantageously take advantage of QFPs, for example to implement shift registers, multiplexers (i.e., MUXs), de-multiplexers (i.e., DEMUXs), and permanent magnetic memories (i.e., PMMs), and the like, and/or employ XY or XYZ addressing schemes, and/or employ control lines that extend in a “braided” pattern across an array of devices. Many of these described approaches are particularly suited for implementing input to and/or output from such processors. Superconducting quantum processors comprising superconducting digital-analog converters (DACs) are provided. The DACs may use kinetic inductance to store energy via thin-film superconducting materials and/or series of Josephson junctions, and may use single-loop or multi-loop designs. Particular constructions of energy storage elements are disclosed, including meandering structures. Galvanic connections between DACs and/or with t...",

  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY <EOH>There exists a need to be able to processor at least some problems having size and/or connectivity greater than (and/or at least not fully provided by) the working graph of an analog processor. Computational systems and methods are described which, at least in some implementations, allow for the computation of at least some problem graphs which have representations which do not fit within the working graph of an analog processor (e.g. because they require more computation devices and/or more/other couplers than the processor provides). A system may be summarized as including: a first two-dimensional array of digital-to-analog converters (DACs) comprising a plurality of DACs arranged in a plurality of sub-arrays, each sub-array comprising a number of rows, a first column of DACs, and a second column of DACs; a first power line coupled to selectively provide a current to the DACs of the first column of each sub-array of the plurality of sub-arrays of the first two-dimensional array; a second power line coupled to selectively provide a current to the DACs of the second column of each sub-array of the plurality of sub-arrays of the first two-dimensional array; and a first control line positioned proximate each DAC along a first diagonal of the first two-dimensional array of DACs to communicatively couple with the respective DACs along the first diagonal of the first two-dimensional array of DACs. The first diagonal of the first two-dimensional array of DACs may extend across each row of the number of rows, the first column, and the second column of each sub-array of the plurality of sub-arrays of the first two-dimensional array of DACs. The system may further include: at least a second two-dimensional array of DACs comprising a plurality of DACs arranged in a plurality of sub-arrays, each sub-array comprising a number of rows, a first column of DACs, and a second column of DACs; wherein the first power line is further coupled to selectively prov...",
