  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>An embodiment of the disclosure meets the needs presented above by generally comprising a band that is configured to couple around a wrist of a user. An electronics module, a vitals module and a button are coupled to the band. The electronics module is configured to wirelessly communicate and to store a medical record of the user. The button and the vitals module are operationally coupled to the electronics module. The button is configured to be depressed to send a panic signal to the electronics module. The vitals module configured to assess at least one vital sign of the user. The vitals module is positioned to relay the at least one vital sign to the electronics module. The electronics module is configured to selectively wirelessly communicate the panic signal, the least one vital sign and the medical record to the emergency response personnel. There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the disclosure in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the disclosure that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. The objects of the disclosure, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the disclosure, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure.",
