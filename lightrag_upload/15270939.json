  "summary": "<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a memory system comprising: a nonvolatile memory including a plurality of blocks as data erase units; measuring unit which measures an erase time at which data of each block is erased; and a block controller which writes data supplied from at least an exterior into a first block which is set in a free state and whose erase time is oldest. According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a memory system comprising: a nonvolatile memory including a plurality of blocks as data erase units; measuring unit which measures an erase time at which data of each block is erased; a block controller which counts an erase count of each block, and has a block table indicating a correspondence relation between a status value indicating one of a free state and an in-use state, the erase time and the erase count for each block; and a first selector which selects a first block whose an erase count is minimum among a preset number of blocks set in the free state starting from a block whose an erase time is oldest based on information of the block table, wherein the block controller writes data supplied from at least an exterior into the first block.
