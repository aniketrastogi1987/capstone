This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Techniques for ink input for browser navigation are described. Generally, ink refers to freehand input to a touch-sensing functionality and/or a functionality for sensing touchless gestures, which is interpreted as digital ink. According to various embodiments, ink input for browser navigation provides a seamless integration of an ink input canvas with a web browser graphical user interface (“GUI”) to enable intuitive input of network addresses (e.g., web addresses) via ink input.",
