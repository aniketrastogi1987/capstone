  "abstract": "Systems and methods of selecting machine learning models/algorithms for a candidate dataset are disclosed. A computer system may access historical data of a set of algorithms applied to a set of benchmark datasets; select a first algorithm of the set of algorithms; apply the first algorithm to an input dataset to create a model of the input dataset; evaluate and store results of the applying; and add the first algorithm to a set of tried algorithms. The computer system may select a next algorithm of the algorithm set via submodular optimization based on the historical data and the set of tried algorithms; apply the next algorithm to the input dataset; capture a next result based on the applying; add the next result to update the set of tried algorithms; and repeat the submodular optimization. The procedure may continue until a termination condition is reached.",
