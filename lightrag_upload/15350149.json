  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments of the invention generally include systems and methods for automatically adjusting content composition rules based on evaluation of user feedback information obtained through a haptic interface. For example, in one embodiment a method is provided which includes accessing user feedback information collected by a haptic interface executing on a computing device, wherein the user feedback information comprises information indicative of a user's reaction towards digital content rendered by the computing device. The digital content includes content that is automatically generated using content composition rules. The method further includes evaluating a quality of the digital content based on the user feedback information, generating an evaluation report that includes information regarding the quality of the digital content, and automatically adjusting one or more content composition rules based on the evaluation report. Other embodiments of the invention will be described in the following detailed description of embodiments, which is to be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",
