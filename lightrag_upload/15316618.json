The criterion is provided to a computing system associated with a developer-user of the application. Evaluation code, for evaluating implementation of the change according to the criterion, is received from the computing system. The evaluation code is caused to execute responsive to receipt of a notice of production deployment of the change. A success rating for the change is determined based upon application performance data attained via execution of the evaluation code.",
