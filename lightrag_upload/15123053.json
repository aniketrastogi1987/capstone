  "abstract": "Facilitate the procedure of evaluating a predictor. This evaluation system comprises an input receiving unit via which elements constituting an evaluation index are specified and an evaluation-index calculation unit that calculates an evaluation-index value for a data set. The evaluation index comprises an element of a first type that evaluates the sample data, an element of a second type that applies weights to the sample data, and an element of a third type that performs a statistical process on a plurality of sample data based on information outputted by the element of the first type and the element of the second type. The evaluation-index calculation unit calculates the above-mentioned evaluation-index value based on the evaluation index comprising the elements received by the input receiving unit.",
