The computing device identifies one or more participants with a relationship to one or more topics of the list of topics. The computing device generates a graph of the list of topics, the one or more participants, and relationships of the one or more participants to the one or more topics, wherein the one or more participants are represented as participant nodes of the graph and the one or more topics are represented as topic nodes of the graph, and wherein the relationships of the one or more participants to the one or more topics are represented as one or more edges connecting participant nodes with topic nodes.",
