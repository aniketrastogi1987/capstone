  "abstract": "Techniques and architectures for analyzing a complex set of objects with a set of rules to provide dynamically generated analysis. The complex set of objects is maintained with corresponding relational information. One or more feature vectors corresponding to the complex set of objects are updated. The feature vector provides a flatter representation of the complex set of objects. The one or more feature vectors are transmitted to a remote client computing device.",
