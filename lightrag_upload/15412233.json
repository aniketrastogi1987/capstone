  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF INVENTION <EOH>According to a first aspect of the present invention, an analysis device for analyzing a system that inputs input data including a plurality of input parameters and outputs output data is provided. The analysis device includes an acquisition unit that acquires learning data including a plurality of sets of the input data and the output data, and a learning processing unit that learns, based on the acquired learning data, an amount of difference of output data corresponding to a difference between input parameters of two pieces of input data. According to another aspect of the present invention, an analysis method for analyzing a system that inputs input data including a plurality of input parameters and outputs output data is provided. The method includes: an acquisition step of acquiring learning data including a plurality of sets of the input data and the output data; and a learning processing step of learning, based on the acquired learning data, an amount of difference of output data corresponding to a difference between input parameters of two pieces of input data. According to another aspect of the present invention, a computer program product for analyzing a system that inputs input data including a plurality of input parameters and outputs output data is provided. The computer program product includes: at least one computer readable non-transitory storage medium having computer readable program instructions thereon for execution by a processor, the computer readable program instructions comprising program instructions for: acquiring learning data including a plurality of sets of the input data and the output data; and learning, based on the acquired learning data, an amount of difference of output data corresponding to a difference between input parameters of two pieces of input data.",
