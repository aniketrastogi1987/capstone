  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods for more efficiently performing a computation of a convolutional neural network layer that is configured to receive an X by Y by Z input tensor and process the received input tensor using one or more convolutional neural network layer weight matrices to generate an U by V by W output tensor. In some aspects the method includes transforming the X by Y by Z input tensor into a X′ by Y′ by Z′ input tensor, wherein X′ is smaller than or equal to X, Y′ is smaller than or equal to Y, and Z′ is larger than or equal to Z; obtaining one or more modified convolutional neural network layer weight matrices, wherein (i) the modified weight matrices operate on the X′ by Y′ by Z′ input tensor to generate a U′ by V′ by W′ output tensor, and (ii) the U′ by V′ by W′ output tensor comprises a transformed U by V by W output tensor, wherein U′ is smaller than or equal to U, V′ is smaller than or equal to V, and W′ is larger than or equal to W; and processing the X′ by Y′ by Z′ input tensor using the modified weight matrices to generate the U′ by V′ by W′ output tensor, wherein the U′ by V′ by W′ output tensor comprises the U by V by W output tensor. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods. A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof installed on the system that in operation may cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions. The foregoing and other embodimen...",
