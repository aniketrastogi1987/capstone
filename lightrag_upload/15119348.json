  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The embodiment of the present invention provides a multi-round session interaction method, system and computer device, to implement the session interaction of a task-based session system whose system actions have a tree-like hierarchical dependency. To reach the above target, the embodiment of the present invention provides a method for interacting in a multi-round session, comprising: receiving user requirement information; mapping the user requirement information to standard requirements contained in nodes of a plurality of locally preset requirement structure trees, the standard requirement contained in each node being a general requirement of standard requirements contained in sub-nodes of the node in the requirement structure trees; and outputting content of the standard requirements contained in sub-nodes of a selected non-leaf node or session information corresponding to a selected leaf node, if the standard requirement contained in the selected node in the plurality of requirement structure trees matches the user requirement information. The embodiment of the present invention further provides a system for interacting in a multi-round session, comprises: a receiving module for receiving user requirement information; a mapping module for mapping the user requirement information to standard requirements contained in nodes of a plurality of locally preset requirement structure trees, the standard requirement contained in each node being a general requirement of standard requirements contained in sub-nodes of the node in the requirement structure trees; and an outputting module for outputting content of the standard requirements contained in sub-nodes of a selected non-leaf node or session information corresponding to a selected leaf node, if the standard requirement contained in the selected node in the plurality of requirement structure trees matches the user requirement information. According to another aspect of the present invention, the ...",
