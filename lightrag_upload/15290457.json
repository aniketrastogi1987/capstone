  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>A method, system and computer-usable medium are disclosed for cognitive inference and learning operations. In one embodiment, the invention relates to a system comprising: a processor; a data bus coupled to the processor; and a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium being coupled to the data bus. The computer program code interacting with a plurality of computer operations and comprising instructions executable by the processor and configured for: receiving data from a plurality of data sources; processing the data from the plurality of data sources, the processing the data from the plurality of data sources identifying a plurality of knowledge elements; and, storing the knowledge elements within the cognitive graph as a collection of knowledge elements, the storing universally representing knowledge obtained from the data; and, generating a cognitive insight based upon the collection of knowledge elements stored within the cognitive graph, the generating the cognitive insight using an insight agent to access the collection of knowledge elements. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the computer program code comprising computer executable instructions configured for: receiving data from a plurality of data sources; processing the data from the plurality of data sources, the processing the data from the plurality of data sources identifying a plurality of knowledge elements; and, storing the knowledge elements within the cognitive graph as a collection of knowledge elements, the storing universally representing knowledge obtained from the data; and, generating a cognitive insight based upon the collection of knowledge elements stored within the cognitive graph, the generating the cognitive insight using an insight agent to access the collection...",
