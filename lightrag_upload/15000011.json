  "abstract": "A stream of attention method, system, and apparatus determines a first focus of attention by applying a probabilistic analysis to a first set of syntactical elements. The syntactical elements may be derived from external communications or from communications generated internally by a computer-implemented system. Alternatively, the syntactical elements may be determined based on their association with images accessed from an external or internal source. Actions are performed by the computer-implemented system that are expected to reduce uncertainty with respect to the focus of attention. Such actions may include posing syntactical-based interrogatives directed to external entities or internally, searching a corpus of content, and/or moving to a new location and receiving input at the new location. Syntactical or image-based information resulting from the actions form the basis for determining a second focus of attention by re-applying to the information the process applied with respect ...",
