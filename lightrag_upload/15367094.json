  "abstract": "Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage media, for selecting action slates using reinforcement learning. One of the methods includes receiving an observation characterizing a current state of an environment; selecting an action slate by processing the observation and a plurality of candidate action slates using a deep neural network, wherein each candidate action slate comprises a respective plurality of actions from the set of actions, and wherein the deep neural network is configured to, for each of the candidate action slates, process the observation and the actions in the candidate action slate to generate a slate Q value for the candidate action slate that is an estimate of a long-term reward resulting from the candidate action slate being provided to the action selector in response to the observation; and providing the selected action slate to an action selector in response to the observation.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>This specification describes technologies that relate to reinforcement learning. In particular, this specification describes techniques for selecting an action slate that includes multiple actions in response to an observation characterizing a state of an environment. An action selector then interacts with the environment by selecting an action, e.g., by selecting an action from the provided action slate. For a system of one or more computers to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the system has installed on it software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them that in operation cause the system to perform the operations or actions. For one or more computer programs to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the one or more programs include instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operations or actions. The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular embodiments so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. A reinforcement learning system can effectively provide slates of actions to an action selector, even when the action that is selected from the slate is not under the control of the reinforcement learning system and even when the action selector can select actions that are not in the provided action slate, i.e. a null action. The reinforcement learning system selects action slates in a manner that optimizes for both the combinatorial and sequential aspects of the action slate selection task, allowing the reinforcement learning system to effectively select action slates even when the space of possible actions is very large. Additionally, the reinforcement learning system can effectively select action slates from high-dimensional observations characterizing the environment. The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the ac...",
