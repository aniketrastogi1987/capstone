  "abstract": "A computer program product and method provides a question and answer service that accepts an initial first question from a user and analyzes the question by a first generation subsystem to generate a first answer. A second generation subsystem of the question and answer service is configured to generate a second question based at least in-part on keywords from the first question and the first answer.",

  "summary": "<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>In accordance with an embodiment, a computer implemented method of operating a question-answering system includes inputting a first question into a user interface by a user. The first question may then be analyzed by a computer device utilizing a corpus of data and outputting a computer generated candidate second question or questions based at least in-part on the first question. By providing a semantically similar question, the present disclosure may assist users to explore an unfamiliar domain and/or ask question with less time and effort than that required for more traditional systems. A computer program product according to another embodiment provides a question-answering service. The service is facilitated by a first generation subsystem of the computer program product that is configured to receive a first question from a user and computer and to generate at least one first answer to the question. A second generation subsystem is configured to generate a second candidate question based at least in-part on keywords from the first question and the content of the first answer or answers.",
